87,"What Was I Thinkin'",Dierks Bentley,2003,b' Becky was a beauty from south Alabama Her daddy had a heart like a nine pound hammer Think he even did a little time in the slammer What was I thinking She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate What was I thinking Oh I knew there d be hell to pay But that crossed my mind a little too late Cause I was Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right There in the middle by me I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get Going where a night might lead I know what I was feeling But what was I thinking what was I thinking By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels Pulled off the road and kicked it in four wheel Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field What was I thinking Out the other side she was hollering faster Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing What was I thinking Oh I knew there d be hell to pay But that crossed my mind a little too late Cause I was Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right There in the middle by me I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get Going where a night might lead I know what I was feeling But what was I thinking what was I thinking When a mountain of a man with a born to kill tattoo Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth We ran outside hood sliding like Bo Duke What was I thinking I finally got her home at a half past too late Her daddy s in a lawn chair sitting on the driveway Put it in park as he started my way What was I thinking oh what was I thinking Then she gave a come and get me grin And like a bullet we were gone again cause I was Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right There in the middle by me I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get Going where a night might lead I know what I was feeling But what was I thinking what was I thinking'
88,"Flying Without Wings",Ruben Studdard,2003,b'Everybody s looking for that something One thing that makes it all complete You ll find it in the strangest places Places you never knew it could be Some find it in the faces of their children Some find it in their lover s eyes Who can deny the joy it brings When you find that special thing You re flying without wings Some find it sharing every morning Some in their solitary lives You ll find it in the words of others A simple line can make you laugh or cry You ll find it in the deepest friendships The kind you cherish all your life And when you know how much that means You have found that special thing You re flying without wings So impossible as they may seem You ve got to fight for every dream Cause who s to know which one you let go Would have made you complete But for me it s waking up beside you yeah To watch the sun rise on your face To know that I can say I love you At any given time or place It s the little things that only I know Those are the things that make you mine all mine And it s the flying without wings Cause you re my special thing I m flying without wings You re the place my life begins And you ll be where it ends I m flying without wings And that s the joy it brings I m flying without wings'
89,"Sing for the Moment",Eminem,2003,b' These ideas are nightmares to white parents Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings Like whatever they say has no bearing It s so scary in a house that allows no swearing To see him walkin around with his headphones blarin Alone in his own zone cold and he don t care he s A problem child and what bothers him all comes out When he talks about his fuckin dad walkin out Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out If he ever saw him again he d probably knock him out His thoughts are wacked he s mad so he s talkin back Talkin black brainwashed from rock and rap He sags his pants do rags and a stockin cap His step father hit him so he socked him back And broke his nose his house is a broken home There s no control he just lets his emotions go Sing with me sing for the year Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Sing it with me it s just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away Entertainment is changin intertwinin with gangsters In the land of the killers a sinner s mind is a sanctum Holy or unholy only have one homie Only this gun lonely cause don t anyone know me Yet everybody just feels like they can relate I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great Or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate It s like these kids hang on every single statement we make Like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen From standin on corners and porches just rappin To havin a fortune no more kissin ass But then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you Fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you To get they hands on every dime you have They want you to lose your mind every time you mad So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon Any dispute won t hesitate to produce handguns That s why these prosecutors wanna convict me Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly But all they kids be listenin to me religiously So I m signin CDs while police fingerprint me They re for the judge s daughter but his grudge is against me If I m such a fuckin menace this shit doesn t make sense B It s all political if my music is literal And I m a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl I couldn t I wouldn t be fit to You re full of shit too Guerrera that was a fist that hit you Sing with me sing for the year Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Sing it with me it s just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away They say music can alter moods and talk to you Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too Well if it can then the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault and I ll get sued See what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols And they wanna get one cause they think the shit s cool Not knowin we really just protectin ourselves We entertainers of course the shit s affectin our sales You ignoramus but music is reflection of self We just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail It s fucked up ain t it How we can come from practically nothin To bein able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted That s why we sing for these kids who don t have a thing Except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine Who post pin up pictures on they walls all day long Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs Or for anyone who s ever been through shit in they lives So they sit and they cry at night wishin they d die Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe We re nothin to you but we re the fuckin shit in they eyes That s why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it Squeeze it and hold it cause we consider these minutes golden And maybe they ll admit it when we re gone just let our spirits Live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can Sing with me sing for the year Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Sing it with me it s just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away Sing with me sing for the year Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Sing it with me it s just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away'
