92,"Don't",Ed Sheeran,2015,b' I met this girl late last year She said don t you worry if I disappear I told her I m not really looking for another mistake I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait But then I jumped right in a week later returned I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn But I gave her my time for two or three nights Then I put it on pause until the moment was right I went away for months until our paths crossed again She told me I was never looking for a friend Maybe you could swing by my room around ten Baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin We ll be in between the sheets till the late AM Baby if you wanted me then should have just said she s singing Don t fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don t wanna know that babe Don t fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don t wanna know that babe And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza Before a text message was the only way to reach her Now she s staying at my place and loves the way I treat her Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature And never wants to sleep I guess that I don t want to either But me and her we make money the same way Four cities two planes the same day And those shows have never been what it s about But maybe we ll go together and just figure it out I d rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch But we should get on a plane or we ll be missing it now Wish I d have written it down the way that things played out When she was kissing him how I was confused about Now she should figure it out while I m sat here singing Don t fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don t wanna know that babe Don t fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don t wanna know that babe on my hotel door I don t even know if she knows what for She was crying on my shoulder I already told ya Trust and respect is what we do this for I never intended to be next But you didn t need to take him to bed that s all And I never saw him as a threat Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course It s not like we were both on tour We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor And I wasn t looking for a promise or commitment But it was never just fun and I thought you were different This is not the way you realised what you wanted It s a bit too much too late if I m honest And all this time God knows I m singing Don t fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don t wanna know that babe Don t fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don t wanna know that babe Don t fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don t wanna know that babe Don t fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don t wanna know that babe'
