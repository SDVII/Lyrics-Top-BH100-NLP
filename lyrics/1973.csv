70,Yesterday Once More,The Carpenters,1973,"b'""And what if there has been a search already? What if I find them in my room?""\nBut here was his room. Nothing and no one in it. No one had peeped in. Even Nastasya had not touched it. But heavens! how could he have left all those things in the hole?\nHe rushed to the corner slipped his hand under the paper pulled the things out and lined his pockets with them. There were eight articles in all: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort he hardly looked to see; then four small leather cases. There was a chain too merely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper that looked like a decoration.... He put them all in the different pockets of his overcoat and the remaining pocket of his trousers trying to conceal them as much as possible. He took the purse too. Then he went out of his room leaving the door open. He walked quickly and resolutely and though he felt shattered he had his senses about him. He was afraid of pursuit he was afraid that in another half-hour another quarter of an hour perhaps instructions would be issued for his pursuit and so at all costs he must hide all traces before then. He must clear everything up while he still had some strength some reasoning power left him.... Where was he to go?\nThat had long been settled: ""Fling them into the canal and all traces hidden in the water the thing would be at an end."" So he had decided in the night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to get up and go away to make haste and get rid of it all. But to get rid of it turned out to be a very difficult task. He wandered along the bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked several times at the steps running down to the water but he could not think of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps\' edge and women were washing clothes on them or boats were moored there and people were swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and noticed from the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go down on purpose stop and throw something into the water. And what if the boxes were to float instead of sinking? And of course they would. Even as it was everyone he met seemed to stare and look round as if they had nothing to do but to watch him. ""Why is it or can it be my fancy?"" he thought.\nAt last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the Neva. There were not so many people there he would be less observed and it would be more convenient in every way above all it was further off. He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it before. And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan simply because he had thought of it in delirium! He had become extremely absent and forgetful and he was aware of it. He certainly must make haste.\nHe walked towards the Neva along V\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Prospect but on the way another idea struck him. ""Why to the Neva? Would it not be better to go somewhere far off to the Islands again and there hide the things in some solitary place in a wood or under a bush and mark the spot perhaps?"" And though he felt incapable of clear judgment the idea seemed to him a sound one. But he was not destined to go there. For coming out of V\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Prospect towards the square he saw on the left a passage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard. On the right hand the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far into the court; on the left a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for twenty paces into the court and then turned sharply to the left. Here was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was lying. At the end of the court the corner of a low smutty stone shed apparently part of some workshop peeped from behind the hoarding. It was probably a carriage builder\'s or carpenter\'s shed; the whole place from the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the place to throw it he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard he slipped in and at once saw near the gate a sink such as is often put in yards where there are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism ""Standing here strictly forbidden."" This was all the better for there would be nothing suspicious about his going in. ""Here I could throw it all in a heap and get away!""\nLooking round once more with his hand already in his pocket he noticed against the outer wall between the entrance and the sink a big unhewn stone weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a street. He could hear passers-by always numerous in that part but he could not be seen from the entrance unless someone came in from the street which might well happen indeed so there was need of haste.\nHe bent down over the stone seized the top of it firmly in both hands and using all his strength turned it over. Under the stone was a small hollow in the ground and he immediately emptied his pocket into it. The purse lay at the top and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then he seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back so that it was in the same position again though it stood a very little higher. But he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot. Nothing could be noticed.\nThen he went out and turned into the square. Again an intense almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant as it had in the police-office. ""I have buried my tracks! And who who can think of looking under that stone? It has been lying there most likely ever since the house was built and will lie as many years more. And if it were found who would think of me? It is all over! No clue!"" And he laughed. Yes he remembered that he began laughing a thin nervous noiseless laugh and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square. But when he reached the K\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Boulevard where two days before he had come upon that girl his laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his mind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat on which after the girl was gone he had sat and pondered and that it would be hateful too to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had given the twenty copecks: ""Damn him!""\nHe walked looking about him angrily and distractedly. All his ideas now seemed to be circling round some single point and he felt that there really was such a point and that now now he was left facing that point\xe2\x80\x94and for the first time indeed during the last two months.\n""Damn it all!"" he thought suddenly in a fit of ungovernable fury. ""If it has begun then it has begun. Hang the new life! Good Lord how stupid it is!... And what lies I told to-day! How despicably I fawned upon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I care for them all and my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It is not that at all!""\nSuddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple question perplexed and bitterly confounded him.\n""If it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically if I really had a certain and definite object how is it I did not even glance into the purse and don\'t know what I had there for which I have undergone these agonies and have deliberately undertaken this base filthy degrading business? And here I wanted at once to throw into the water the purse together with all the things which I had not seen either... how\'s that?""\nYes that was so that was all so. Yet he had known it all before and it was not a new question for him even when it was decided in the night without hesitation and consideration as though so it must be as though it could not possibly be otherwise.... Yes he had known it all and understood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out of it.... Yes so it was.\n""It is because I am very ill"" he decided grimly at last ""I have been worrying and fretting myself and I don\'t know what I am doing.... Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been worrying myself.... I shall get well and I shall not worry.... But what if I don\'t get well at all? Good God how sick I am of it all!""\nHe walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for some distraction but he did not know what to do what to attempt. A new overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him every moment; this was an immeasurable almost physical repulsion for everything surrounding him an obstinate malignant feeling of hatred. All who met him were loathsome to him\xe2\x80\x94he loathed their faces their movements their gestures. If anyone had addressed him he felt that he might have spat at him or bitten him....\nHe stopped suddenly on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva near the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. ""Why he lives here in that house"" he thought ""why I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord! Here it\'s the same thing over again.... Very interesting to know though; have I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance? Never mind I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him the day after; well and so I will! Besides I really cannot go further now.""\nHe went up to Razumihin\'s room on the fifth floor.\nThe latter was at home in his garret busily writing at the moment and he opened the door himself. It was four months since they had seen each other. Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown with slippers on his bare feet unkempt unshaven and unwashed. His face showed surprise.\n""Is it you?"" he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; then after a brief pause he whistled. ""As hard up as all that! Why brother you\'ve cut me out!"" he added looking at Raskolnikov\'s rags. ""Come sit down you are tired I\'ll be bound.""\nAnd when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa which was in even worse condition than his own Razumihin saw at once that his visitor was ill.\n""Why you are seriously ill do you know that?"" He began feeling his pulse. Raskolnikov pulled away his hand.\n""Never mind"" he said ""I have come for this: I have no lessons.... I wanted... but I don\'t really want lessons....""\n""But I say! You are delirious you know!"" Razumihin observed watching him carefully.\n""No I am not.""\nRaskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted the stairs to Razumihin\'s he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend face to face. Now in a flash he knew that what he was least of all disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the wide world. His spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at himself as soon as he crossed Razumihin\'s threshold.\n""Good-bye"" he said abruptly and walked to the door.\n""Stop stop! You queer fish.""\n""I don\'t want to"" said the other again pulling away his hand.\n""Then why the devil have you come? Are you mad or what? Why this is... almost insulting! I won\'t let you go like that.""\n""Well then I came to you because I know no one but you who could help... to begin... because you are kinder than anyone\xe2\x80\x94cleverer I mean and can judge... and now I see that I want nothing. Do you hear? Nothing at all... no one\'s services... no one\'s sympathy. I am by myself... alone. Come that\'s enough. Leave me alone.""\n""Stay a minute you sweep! You are a perfect madman. As you like for all I care. I have no lessons do you see and I don\'t care about that but there\'s a bookseller Heruvimov\xe2\x80\x94and he takes the place of a lesson. I would not exchange him for five lessons. He\'s doing publishing of a kind and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they have! The very titles are worth the money! You always maintained that I was a fool but by Jove my boy there are greater fools than I am! Now he is setting up for being advanced not that he has an inkling of anything but of course I encourage him. Here are two signatures of the German text\xe2\x80\x94in my opinion the crudest charlatanism; it discusses the question \'Is woman a human being?\' And of course triumphantly proves that she is. Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a contribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he will expand these two and a half signatures into six we shall make up a gorgeous title half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! He pays me six roubles the signature it works out to about fifteen roubles for the job and I\'ve had six already in advance. When we have finished this we are going to begin a translation about whales and then some of the dullest scandals out of the second part of Les Confessions we have marked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov that Rousseau was a kind of Radishchev. You may be sure I don\'t contradict him hang him! Well would you like to do the second signature of \'Is woman a human being?\' If you would take the German and pens and paper\xe2\x80\x94all those are provided and take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles in advance on the whole thing three roubles come to you for your share. And when you have finished the signature there will be another three roubles for you. And please don\'t think I am doing you a service; quite the contrary as soon as you came in I saw how you could help me; to begin with I am weak in spelling and secondly I am sometimes utterly adrift in German so that I make it up as I go along for the most part. The only comfort is that it\'s bound to be a change for the better. Though who can tell maybe it\'s sometimes for the worse. Will you take it?""\nRaskolnikov took the German sheets in silence took the three roubles and without a word went out. Razumihin gazed after him in astonishment. But when Raskolnikov was in the next street he turned back mounted the stairs to Razumihin\'s again and laying on the table the German article and the three roubles went out again still without uttering a word.\n""Are you raving or what?"" Razumihin shouted roused to fury at last. ""What farce is this? You\'ll drive me crazy too... what did you come to see me for damn you?""\n""I don\'t want... translation"" muttered Raskolnikov from the stairs.\n""Then what the devil do you want?"" shouted Razumihin from above. Raskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence.\n""Hey there! Where are you living?""\nNo answer.\n""Well confound you then!""\nBut Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street. On the Nikolaevsky Bridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant incident. A coachman after shouting at him two or three times gave him a violent lash on the back with his whip for having almost fallen under his horses\' hoofs. The lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the railing . He angrily clenched and ground his teeth. He heard laughter of course.\n""Serves him right!""\n""A pickpocket I dare say.""\n""Pretending to be drunk for sure and getting under the wheels on purpose; and you have to answer for him.""\n""It\'s a regular profession that\'s what it is.""\nBut while he stood at the railing still looking angry and bewildered after the retreating carriage and rubbing his back he suddenly felt someone thrust money into his hand. He looked. It was an elderly woman in a kerchief and goatskin shoes with a girl probably her daughter wearing a hat and carrying a green parasol.\n""Take it my good man in Christ\'s name.""\nHe took it and they passed on. It was a piece of twenty copecks. From his dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar asking alms in the streets and the gift of the twenty copecks he doubtless owed to the blow which made them feel sorry for him.\nHe closed his hand on the twenty copecks walked on for ten paces and turned facing the Neva looking towards the palace. The sky was without a cloud and the water was almost bright blue which is so rare in the Neva. The cupola of the cathedral which is seen at its best from the bridge about twenty paces from the chapel glittered in the sunlight and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished. The pain from the lash went off and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one uneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely. He stood still and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was especially familiar to him. When he was attending the university he had hundreds of times\xe2\x80\x94generally on his way home\xe2\x80\x94stood still on this spot gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him. It left him strangely cold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and mistrusting himself put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly recalled those old doubts and perplexities and it seemed to him that it was no mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange and grotesque that he should have stopped at the same spot as before as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts be interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him... so short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing and yet it wrung his heart. Deep down hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him now\xe2\x80\x94all his old past his old thoughts his old problems and theories his old impressions and that picture and himself and all all.... He felt as though he were flying upwards and everything were vanishing from his sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand he suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He opened his hand stared at the coin and with a sweep of his arm flung it into the water; then he turned and went home. It seemed to him he had cut himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.\nEvening was coming on when he reached home so that he must have been walking about six hours. How and where he came back he did not remember. Undressing and quivering like an overdriven horse he lay down on the sofa drew his greatcoat over him and at once sank into oblivion....\nIt was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. Good God what a scream! Such unnatural sounds such howling wailing grinding tears blows and curses he had never heard.\nHe could never have imagined such brutality such frenzy. In terror he sat up in bed almost swooning with agony. But the fighting wailing and cursing grew louder and louder. And then to his intense amazement he caught the voice of his landlady. She was howling shrieking and wailing rapidly hurriedly incoherently so that he could not make out what she was talking about; she was beseeching no doubt not to be beaten for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs. The voice of her assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost a croak; but he too was saying something and just as quickly and indistinctly hurrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov trembled; he recognised the voice\xe2\x80\x94it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch. Ilya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her banging her head against the steps\xe2\x80\x94that\'s clear that can be told from the sounds from the cries and the thuds. How is it is the world topsy-turvy? He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys and all the staircases; he heard voices exclamations knocking doors banging. ""But why why and how could it be?"" he repeated thinking seriously that he had gone mad. But no he heard too distinctly! And they would come to him then next ""for no doubt... it\'s all about that... about yesterday.... Good God!"" He would have fastened his door with the latch but he could not lift his hand... besides it would be useless. Terror gripped his heart like ice tortured him and numbed him.... But at last all this uproar after continuing about ten minutes began gradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya Petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses.... But at last he too seemed to be silent and now he could not be heard. ""Can he have gone away? Good Lord!"" Yes and now the landlady is going too still weeping and moaning... and then her door slammed.... Now the crowd was going from the stairs to their rooms exclaiming disputing calling to one another raising their voices to a shout dropping them to a whisper. There must have been numbers of them\xe2\x80\x94almost all the inmates of the block. ""But good God how could it be! And why why had he come here!""\nRaskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa but could not close his eyes. He lay for half an hour in such anguish such an intolerable sensation of infinite terror as he had never experienced before. Suddenly a bright light flashed into his room. Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate of soup. Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not asleep she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she had brought\xe2\x80\x94bread salt a plate a spoon.\n""You\'ve eaten nothing since yesterday I warrant. You\'ve been trudging about all day and you\'re shaking with fever.""\n""Nastasya... what were they beating the landlady for?""\nShe looked intently at him.\n""Who beat the landlady?""\n""Just now... half an hour ago Ilya Petrovitch the assistant superintendent on the stairs.... Why was he ill-treating her like that and... why was he here?""\nNastasya scrutinised him silent and frowning and her scrutiny lasted a long time. He felt uneasy even frightened at her searching eyes.\n""Nastasya why don\'t you speak?"" he said timidly at last in a weak voice.\n""It\'s the blood"" she answered at last softly as though speaking to herself.\n""Blood? What blood?"" he muttered growing white and turning towards the wall.\nNastasya still looked at him without speaking.\n""Nobody has been beating the landlady"" she declared at last in a firm resolute voice.\nHe gazed at her hardly able to breathe.\n""I heard it myself.... I was not asleep... I was sitting up"" he said still more timidly. ""I listened a long while. The assistant superintendent came.... Everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the flats.""\n""No one has been here. That\'s the blood crying in your ears. When there\'s no outlet for it and it gets clotted you begin fancying things.... Will you eat something?""\nHe made no answer. Nastasya still stood over him watching him.\n""Give me something to drink... Nastasya.""\nShe went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water. He remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling some on his neck. Then followed forgetfulness.'"
