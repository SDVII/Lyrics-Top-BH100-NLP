7,"In the End",Linkin Park,2002,b' It starts with one One thing I don t know why It doesn t even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain in due time All I know Time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down to the end of the day The clock ticks life away It s so unreal You didn t look out below Watch the time go right out the window Tryin to hold on didn t even know I wasted it all just to watch you go I kept everything inside And even though I tried it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be a memory Of a time when I tried so hard I tried so hard and got so far But in the end it doesn t even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end it doesn t even matter One thing I don t know why It doesn t even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme To remind myself how I tried so hard In spite of the way you were mockin me Actin like I was part of your property Remembering all the times you fought with me I m surprised it got so far Things aren t the way they were before You wouldn t even recognize me anymore Not that you knew me back then But it all comes back to me in the end You kept everything inside And even though I tried it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard I tried so hard and got so far But in the end it doesn t even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end it doesn t even matter I ve put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go For all this There s only one thing you should know I ve put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go For all this There s only one thing you should know I tried so hard and got so far But in the end it doesn t even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end it doesn t even matter'

18,"I Need a Girl (Part Two)",P. Diddy,2002,b' I said for years I heard I took Hollow s name and I steal bars And y all had the nerve to book this shit on Hallows Lane At the Steel Yard But ain t no need to wonder what kinda angles I m about to take Cause out the gate we gon get this multiple choice out the way Should I A Give him gun bars cause that s what my people love Or B Prove I m more of a Don than he ever was Or C Bring up that time we was brawlin in the club Yo London y all know the answer right I got a bullet with somebody s government on it It s time to send it They don t need to ask the name on this Hollow cause Nigel been it What chu gon do Pull out paperwork Have some kinda gimmick Til I blow your brains all over that L O M brand That should help you mind ya business This was booked for Houston til his people told him that he shouldn t do it Tried to warn him to not appear pressure like a good influence Never seen a duck before Here s one lookin stupid But the last time we seen Hollow in the mirror is when I put him through it But let me guess to beat you I ma need a bunch of random shit Like Xanny scripts from Anna Smith Evander s fist and Santa s list Wrong How bout smoke from a Sig Call it my cancer stick Slanted clips that goes both ways that s a banana split That hammer lift I ll put the grip on his cheek like when granny pinch When you go ya son go your girl make it a family trip I was gon get him separate ways but I don t like seein families split So I got him all in one shot that s a family pic But why we never see you wit a chick I gotta watch this guy I mean not even the mother of ya child What chu got to hide I think you bi and live a pair of lies so you can t stand it No wonder you named yourself Hollow cause you the trans parent Hollow pulls out a sign that says He Stole That Line But what s ya son name again Lennon Look Lennon I know ya mom trippin Cause Daddy don t wanna make her an honest woman so you gettin raised off of my whippings Next time he go to discipline you you tell him he wastin his time Lennon Until Mommy get the biggest rock band ever Every beat ll be coming from John Lennon But please don t say the John if you ain t sayin it twice And if you don t add Da Don you ain t sayin it right Want some advice Change ya name cause you not no Don bro But he can say it twice like me so I can hollow Hollow Now hollow Hollow or Hollow hollow Talkin headshot leg shot how low Hollow No red dot dead shot I ll high low Hollow Laughin under my breath hee hee ha llow Hollow But y all said I got my name from him Fuck no never You had no influence on my career whatsoever I don t drink syrup or profit off of taxes for cheap shirts And post importantly I would never lose a fight if I swing first Now I mma prove he ain t nothin like how he appear to y all And I got the perfect way to do this Hollow let s play Swear To God Swear to God you ain t ask me to not bring up the fight and made me sign an NDA Don t worry John John brings out the supposed NDA contract This the Non Disclosure Agreement but guess what Nigga fuck you I ma talk about it anyway Aye I know y all heard the rumors I m not sayin that they all the truth But if I didn t beat yo ass when you swung on me first why did they have to pull me off of you But that s old Hollow Didn t he pull out that jacket vers Ars to be the old Hollow What if I told y all I brought the jacket I wore when we fought to finish this beatin I owed Hollow John John acts like he s going to pull out the jacket Got him Aye nah nah nah but truth be told Hollow we ain t really scrap dawg I mean you swung missed I swung hit and broke the mirror wit chu that s all As far as Calicoe jumpin in That was a fact y all Ayo Twork they ain t know it was me Standin over the body with my glasses and my hat off I m only here cause I m gettin that cash It s a body and it s time for you to get in that bag Matter of fact scratch that Can t even use that slogan it doesn t feel right Cause I already whipped that ass in real life Time nigga Yoooooooooo I said Hollow Da Don in London versus I m bout to fuck you up nigga Y all really gon call him John John when he get split in two Get the blade from my nigga in London clap clap And that leads to a liver pool How dare you call me scared You emotional fool I m only raisin awareness with a 9 cause that s my promotional tool You had your gums bumpin sayin I m scared but done nothin Til he finally get a Hollow now John John the one duckin Nigga I got somethin that I owed John So I load up with the old jawn And take my shot close range like the old John Flip his shit cause he got somethin that he owe Hollow So I load up with the old Hollow But this time tape on the handle Naomi Campbell it s the old model From a block up I can spot ya like cop lights With that r r r r r r RAKA BAKA that was not nice I ain t toleratin no disrespect I m not playin tonight I m givin you one warning John John I m not sayin it twice I know y all love that old Hollow but all in all Life changed I became more mature I had a son and many nights I ignored him Focused on that Parmesan so I wanna say this here tonight I m sorry John It s Dad Y all remember doin impersonations on Grind Time and I said Oh it s just a fad It s Dad Y all remember when you called me when you made it to URL and I said Give it everything you had It s Dad I mean you came into this game as my son Wanted to be Wade to my Lebron so he named himself Da Don But I m Hollow you John You Marlon I m Shawn I m B I G you Shyne If I get big you shine You Gain if I tied You Odom I m Shaq You Nordstrom I m Saks I m Polo you Chaps How the fuck is we a match I mean he even got pictures of me when I was a Wildcat on guard But I m his idol ain t I suppose to be on John Wall Don t lie fam I m the nigga you ve been chasin for awhile The man done studied every bar I land I hate he came in wit my style Nigga Summer Madness I battled Hitman my name was known In battle rap and the streets that s how I caught a case for slangin zones Then I found out Smack Illuminati down with Skull Bones Cause I came home Summer Madness 2 y all had made my clone That s when you thought you was gonna be Smack gunner Shit he was even sayin Roc won t stay Y all could ve paid a few Gs he still won t trade John for Tay That s cause you came into my name without payin homage My nigga that s like Isiah Thomas comin in the league sayin Fuck Isiah Thomas I mean Surf said you donned his Lux said the Don King they was turnin my name slick But you fuck around annnd did a permanent name flip When you type the letter H into searches The word Hollow emerges You press Space and move the cursor then Da Don will surface I m more important than any How question Halloween or Hollow Earth is He worship to the point I got Loyalty Over Money he got Bars Over Bullshit Same logo I got I m not excited he got Shrug Life I do one round with Pat Stay he do one round wit Pat Stay I do 106 bro this shit is annoying But it wasn t until I seen him against PC doin torture shit like Jason Voorhees That s when I was fully convinced he Jason Bourne d me But he gon say You got Rocko Da Don and Polow Da Don But in battle rap you only got me You seen my highlights you seen my pace and then copied I m sure when you made the discovery you were Shocked G But I got my name from Makaveli Da Don you better Pac me He even let niggas call him the Dininon Oooow that shit is wrong But you re such a follower you moved to Atlanta when you was little John He seen me against Clips givin him the business loan After that I was passin Roc like a kidney stone Then I did small room had to get in my zone Now they got me battlin a nigga that look like he could fix my phone You see how he diss me for L O M But that ain t what I got on I switched it cause I m dippin in HiddenLabelClothing com You wish I was done nigga not now You wanted to go unlimited so I ma go off the top now I said I let the fo fo go pulled it on him he like Oh no bro He sound like Smack durin Arsonal and Twork I don t want no mo smoke Then they said why they booked him here I said Yeah I don t know why they booked you here cause you really steal bars I had to tell the venue to really chill y all like John John s in town he might steal The Steel Yard So you know who to call if a theft s involved Aye London watch out he might steal the D O N from y all I said he wanted to go unlimited Smack so I mma go off the top now Nigga I can rap about street shit I really had to tote the pound With an AR the size of International P I gotta hold it down It s funny I mention ARP cause Mook last battle we couldn t play the joint Talkin bout he Michael Jordan in Space Jam cause he gotta reach just to make a point He can t take a hard loss and you ll take an easy win quickly Actin like you bury Rum please have some dignity I ll catch you at the intersection Bullets enter sections leave his body in a section That means if it s a green light my people blast him He ll slow down like a yellow when he seen the ratchet The Glock had the beam attachment Niggas usually stop when they see red that mean people passin So don t worry bout his next round and if y all act like the fake Don winnin Then I ll be the reason to piece to John Lennon Loyalty Over Money man Now when they first announced this battle was booked in the UK I was told y all favorited him more so they didn t know how I would look in the UK But due to Hollow graphic bars he may shine But I ain t shook in the UK Cause it was time me and this Gor Don Ram see I told y all I ma cook in the UK So hit the lights close the curtain this where the show stop No pork no lamb but today we makin GOAT chop just for you K But for you K already cold cock Before the shot Code Red After the shot Don t Flop Fuck if he doin me a favor nobody asked you to I feel like whatever y all got between y all That s Smack and you No need a match for Mook You don t need to look no further Cause after I take this shot with a Hollow close range chances are I m gettin booked for murder Stupid guy why would you take this battle knowin you would die You plan on takin DJ Khaled s son to court Cause that s suicide 40 000 for Lux yeah right maybe 25 I guess it s true I am denying Hollow cost I figured you would lie How can y all not see I m sick and what I really discovered Concentrate on ya camp Cause if I spread one germ many will suffer and it ll be another World War too Millions will get killed the plot was fake but who the reparations go to is real I ve seen you get your uppercut then another cut then another cut Yo Tay Roc I see you had problems gettin ya seat belt to buckle up Aye but the Summer s up it s still Madness So let me twerk that line I m Strapped In Cause what I pull from the shoulder buckle and click mine work just fine You see dude a bitch actin gay you look pissed Y all the break out lose the grip grab the blade use a pick Madden play you should quit and that s okay Just let ya guy know I ll pick apart a pussy if you the risk I have to take Cause as of late you couldn t Roc wit Tay and barely Surf with Tsu Just because you was Loaded for Lux don t mean you Murda Mook You lost ya Arsonal and only had one Clip for Charlie Let Dizaster ruin your world then Pat Stay for the party Let s talk now go head and say how Bullpen ain t doin well And how I m losin all my top battlers to the URL Cause I told em Fuck the PG s when I m from the PG s you sound stupid now Cause if the sky s the limit what s there for you to prove in Grounds Do y all see the vision I went from lost to a boss it s the ascension Since the beginning I took every name on them contracts Beasley sent in All I did was play chess you know with two of the most important pieces switchin That s cause I knew callin out the cast ll put a rook in a king position Now look at me Became everything they said I couldn t be Wasn t Started From The Bottom yours first for you to cook and eat But I guess a Don is Drake s son cause he took the beat Now he tellin stories how he got at a Don just to push a tee But worry bout the bars don t worry what he got on But if you is worried don t go to LOMclothing com Cause that shit is not bomb whoever buys that shit got the worst taste And if you ain t want us to worry bout what you got on then why the fuck you put it on in the first place Yeah I peeped ya little charity work that s such a bogus scam I know ya plan Raise ya company awareness to the local fans But you d rather feed a random homeless man than to help ya mother own some land How is it Loyalty Over Money when you disown ya fam to promote ya brand Why you never do that shit in Queens If you really care just take a look at Hollow Gram he was never really there But ya hollow s give back in a different way That s how you say the line Okay then fine but my Hollow s take backs like you gave it away then changed ya mind Hold on hold on Fake chokes for 14 seconds Hold on hold on my fault y all I got it I didn t mean to keep everybody waitin But I promise that wasn t a choke y all just didn t peep the body language I did this this this then this is it clear now That s cause he knows before I take any lip he gettin aired out BAOW I m only here cause I m gettin that cash This is a body and it s time for you to get in that bag Matter of fact scratch that can t even use that slogan doesn t feel right Cause I already whipped that ass in real life Time Quality over quantity he can rap all night I punched you dead in yo motherfuckin face nigga And you went to Twitter to outburst Well tell Smack Lock us in a room let s see who comin out first I punched a nigga in his shit like Yo I m not no bitch One hook had his mouth off like a Chinese flick Here go a one Hollow mid round off the top flips Let s play Swear To God nigga Swear to God Calicoe ain t snuff you Shut the fuck up nigga he lumped you Swear to God Mike Moon ain t punch you I don t know who that is Shut the fuck up nigga he Homer Simpson Duff ed you Swear to God my man MB B ain t rush you Swear to God So my point is how you beat me up when niggas actually jumped you That Worldstar shit would never happen nigga It was sad as shit but it s cool I m peaceful now so let s get past the fist I m the only battle rapper that got the same nigga from him from his first battle what I m lyin for But where s Swag Inc Where s the niggas behind you when you battled B Magic Where s Syahboy Hold on that s your 2 on 2 partner I know he gotta be beside ya boy John John I m way in the back and I still can t find ya boy But I m disloyal They said John John being aggressive but he mad we ain t looked at equally You re such on a low frequency you gotta scream just to speak to me See all this battle rap persona shit you done took it too far How you gonna stand up here and tell me bout me nigga When you don t know who the fuck you are John McGee born in Yonkers left a little after 8 So how you claimin School Street when nigga you ain t graduate By 15 he was on the road seeing fame for free Actin like ya upbringing was So So yeah cause you grew up under Jermaine Dupri So you tellin me when it s beef you had to call Bow And you being down with So So Def explains why you act like Da Brat you are now All they ll say is Hollow won t battle Surf won t battle me All we hear is John complain and watch John campaign like he fuckin John McCain I should break ya legs just for steppin in my lane And smack JD while screamin Money Ain t A Thang I wondered how he knew JD and Bow Wow I thought it was through his hustle puttin in mad pain You ain t grind to get on TV Oh I guess it s all part of the rap game Well hi John I ain t made enough so I m still liable to do crazy stuff Like I ll pay a nigga to beat yo ass then help break it up Nigga I could damage anything he did or said you re probably a lame Bad bitch with a big forehead I m goin out with a bang I know it just sound like me barkin But I m the butcher and he s sleepwalkin through a meat market James Earl Jones let s do some deep talkin I think awkward like Steve Hawking in Stephen King s office Like what if everything we been on had been wrong What if the Devil is good What if cigarettes help you live long What if Mike never changed his skin tone What if John John the real Don What if God is bad Y all catch that That s Pastor Troy y all know Pastor Troy Well that s legit I know he caught it he s a bar thief he won t let me get past the flip I mean I know y all gon be like Not this angle but nigga yeah This guy s a thief London if he was part of the Great Train Robbery C mon Johnny that s how you got poppin please You looked at the Lifestyle Of The Rich Famous then rob and leech I actually wrote down every bar he every stole Hollow brings out a scroll Unfortunately it s too long to scroll But stop actin like you re up when you re scared of heights I should give him an eye full just for being a parasite Greaseball you ll rush a scheme with some bars he found Lookin at up and comers that s Hungry and then mark it down I should drag him through Prague then across the pond cause he don t have a check Talkin bout a wager nigga you don t have a rack to bet I told him I could wait but in due time in the end I still told dude Bye See that last scheme was important to see I dragged him through Europe then Asia to show y all catchin a body in another country is not foreign to me Nigga ya flow snoring boring to me Y all know how we got money for battle rap He got us all together he said I could make some quick cash You see these cars behind me You see these books I could help you get rich fast Us brothers gotta stick together let our melanin gleam I said Ain t this a bitch A conscious brother studyin Egypt while doing pyramid schemes Y all know how I got money before battle rap I had to slang butter Nigga judge cook a biscuit from scratch like Martin Payne mother If they caught us with the white we blew fore it changed colors So now the D sit in the lobby like the Wayans Brothers I swear to God don t fuck with him I m doin some damage that insurance ain t coverin It won t be fun but they ll be fun raisin and GoFund ing him Once I put him down to Earth it s so humblin Nigga fuck you fuck what you got on and I fucked ya mom While you was locked up by the way I don t know if you knew that I said John John don t fuck with him I ll clicka clicka buckin him I ll put a nigga face on the bag like Uncle Ben By the way my brother dipped I know ya mother been wonderin where your uncle been Lately I been on some other shit I seen evil like Cousin It but eat people like Brotha Lynch Lately I ve been buggin quick I got a fuckin stick the bottom got a rubber grip Sound like a plummer s kit boy I m comin up wit shit I said he gon diss me L O M but that ain t what I got on I switched it cause I m dippin in HiddenLabelClothing com This the battle for the name right Nah see y all gots to chill Yeah I know they booked Da Don versus Da Don that headline the bill Ever wonder who got the name and who havin problems still We just established he swung on me this nigga tried to steal Da Don for real Nah what the fuck have I ever done to you Did I threaten ya life or somethin Have I ever pulled a gun on you So what you throw that punch to prove See any card he pulled a real Donald Trump it can show this pussy not untouchable He was scared I d replace him to bad you can t avoid that So when it s all said and done I d probably be the one to employ Smack The way ya voice cracks you should get some bed rest more fam Cause if you wasn t so Sleepy Hollow you ll probably come off the head less horse Man you can t rap Hollow pulls out a sign that says He Stole That Man you can t rap you just do a lot of rambling well See me I got the total package to address whoever s stampin this male Remind you of that first L O M shirt that he managed to sell Cause in so many words I m designed to hand you an L I can punch scheme angle flippin bars is my go to Remember I m Shang Tsung I can kill you witcha own moves That was old school These days I m more versatile But since you took it past rap we gon get more personal When ya sister boyfriend beat her ass you wasn t thinkin bout hurtin a nigga It was Hoffa that came through ready to put somebody in the dirt for the nigga It s like God tried reversing the picture Cause how you go from helpin ya sister with her math homework To bringing Math home to help put in work for ya sister That was ya guy he would ride to the pop of the wheels When he got jumped out in Cali whatchu do Take a pic with the op for a film If that was me Shit you said it I m John John I m known to slide wit the steel Fuck a Joseph Khan movie Dizaster should ve got Bodied for real But you booked a battle wit him and kept a secret bout that You ain t even let ya man know when it was goin down so he could bounce back It s only science history and literature when he s speakin bout class That s these L O M niggas yeah Leavin Out Math He was mad when we battled cause Hollow told him we was beefin Well on my mother s son until you threw that punch I didn t know that we was beefin But you said on AngryFan you wanted to punch me in my mouth cause I told you to suck my dick on Twitter Well excuse me Hollow what I meant was tell ya mother to suck my dick you bitch ass nigga The next time y all see Math y all get this message to him Cause I m the real reason Hollow left NYB let s get this settled as men Has nothing to do with Math Cortez D Chamberz or the rest of they friends Nah I m lyin cause it was after our little scuffle he ain t want nothin to do with hands ever again So don t tell me this the nigga you gon let ya children idolize Either y all believe them idol lies or watchin him with idle eyes You played yourself by several accounts he think he Vada Fly Headshot he ll go from I m not excited to I m not alive But I wanna apologize to my ex that said I hit her and played a helpless role Even though she attacked me I still could ve showed more self control It hurt my soul when I seen all them people switch up Cause where was that energy when y all heard I beat this bitch up You hypocrites I don t condone domestic violence in the thinnest bit But you do cause when I watch ya battles all your punches hit or miss That s why he need these antics the fan got no poise You like to think outside the box cool BAOW Now you ain t got no choice So it don t matter if you rip ya shirt switch ya merch or hit the Earth Cause real niggas only respect the bars when you spit ya verse So when this battle dropped for the YouTubers to click and search Comments gon read Nice try Hollow But it didn t work Like when you put that intercom in the generator without knowin what that does to ya enemies Wait a minute I get it you put an intercom in a generator cause you was tryin to get a buzz off of energy Silly me tryin to sell that bullshit hopin someone else will buy it You should put a ventilator in a refrigerator What that do I dunno but he dumb enough to try it But you can have them roastin sessions I ain t into joke professions I m loadin weapons like vape pens you could get smoked in seconds I could teach you a thing or two bout how to hold a Wesson Right you wanna stretch him Hold it downward dawg I m givin yoga lessons So whoever think we came for a fight He tried that made the biggest fuckin mistake of his life Now please don t say the John if you ain t sayin it twice And if you don t add the Da Don Goodnight man Dear Stan this is actually not one of them rounds where I talk to him unfortunately This actually the round where I talk to me And I ask How did I create this hate Maybe I ain t embrace you in ways you made it safe And I was angry about the name okay Buy you can t have me named as prey while I m movin with amazin ways You want the Da Don then have it But not before I give John 3 16 s like John is Catholic Or behead him in front of y all now John The Baptist I DiVinci d the damn Code I won t let my face show like Basquiat til a grand show Paint the wall wit him then tell my nigga in the van Go Fuck the gun bars yo stop my time You beatin bitches you bitch ass nigga You hittin on women you bitch ass nigga I m just jokin cause I m no longer a tough guy that s not my line Plus he not Joe Budden and there s not no time My nigga you went from stealin bars to stealin broads Let s take that further He black like a cat burglar beat her back like she Nat Turner Not only did he get domestic violence he got aggravated with assault that s worser Actin like she s your wall then you flat Earth d her He even said She put up money for Bullpen Battle League she was the stack earner She put money in the pot made you hot and how d you get her back Burn her Bro he beat her ass so much he can t even lift his arm He be like BITCH WHAT YOU FLINCHING FOR Mind you Chelsea 4 11 and he s 6 foot 4 See the problem is he never learned responsibility or accountability She beggin him like John help me with the utilities You lost your freedom over your emotions how While she out here wearin the pants like Hillary Then he found a number that s why he beat her That s what he had to wonder Why she stabbed him in the back Cause dependin on how you act you punch her I blame his mother cause he got his game from a woman He got his traits from a woman He even complain like a woman He even chase another man for his name like a woman Jay Z said a male shouldn t be jealous that s a female trait Oh you mad I get 30 for a battle and you get 8 No I said he get 30 d for a battle and you get At 21 you started dissin me 22 he s still dissin me 23 and 24 I m thinkin This some good publicity I said by 25 he smoked his first blunt Had his first gun at 26 Middle man to quarter pound for 27 now he thinkin he Money Mitch At 28 he s still lyin bout throwin me through a mirror it adds up Cause that broken mirror actually gave YOU seven years of bad luck I said fuck that I ll leave a message and get back to him Like beep I ll do voodoo I ll take a patch of him and start detaching him You ll
