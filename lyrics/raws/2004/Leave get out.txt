 Mmm oh Yeah yeah I ve been waiting all day here for ya babe So won t you come and sit and talk to me And tell me how we re gonna be together always Hope you know that when it s late at night I hold on to my pillow tight And think of how you promised me forever Could make me feel this way oh Is just a chance to say Get out right now It s the end of you and me It s too late and I can t wait for you to be gone Cause I know about her and I wonder How I bought all the lies You said that you would treat me right But you was just a waste of time Tell me why you re looking so confused When I m the one who didn t know the truth How could you ever be so cold To go behind my back and call my friend Boy you must have gone and bumped your head Because you left her number on your phone Maybe I m the one to blame but Well it didn t work out that way Get out right now It s the end of you and me It s too late and I can t wait for you to be gone Cause I know about her and I wonder How I bought all the lies You said that you would treat me right But you was just a waste of time I wanted you right here with me But I have no choice you ve gotta leave Because my heart is breakin With every word I m sayin I gave up everything I had On somethin that just wouldn t last But I refuse to cry No tears will fall from these eyes Oh oh Get out Get out right now It s the end of you and me It s too late and I can t wait for you to be gone Cause I know about her and I wonder How I bought all the lies You said that you would treat me right But you was just a waste of time Get out right now It s the end of you and me It s too late and I can t wait for you to be gone Cause I know about her and I wonder How I bought all the lies You said that you would treat me right But you was just a waste of time Get out You and me It s too late You Bout her You said that you would treat me right But you was just a waste of time Oh oh oh oh
