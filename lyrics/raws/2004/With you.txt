 Every time you re near baby I get kinda crazy in my head for you I don t know what to do And oh baby I get kinda shaky when they mention you I just lose my cool My friends tell me Something has come over me And I think I know what it is I think I m in love Boy I think that I m in love with you Got me doin silly things when it comes to you Boy I think that I m in love with you I ve been telling all my friends what I feel for you Just the other night baby I saw you hangin You were with your crew I was with mine too You took me by surprise When you turn and look me in my eyes Boy you really blew my mind I don t know what s gotten into me But I kinda think I know what it is I think I m in love Boy I think that I m in love with you Got me doin silly things when it comes to you Boy I think that I m in love with you I ve been telling all my friends what I feel for you Boy I think that I m in love with you Got me telling all my friends what I feel for you I think I m in love Boy I think that I m in love with you Got me doin silly things when it comes to you Boy I think that I m in love with you I ve been telling all my friends what I feel for you Boy I think that I m in love with you Got me telling all my friends what I feel for you Something strange has come over me Got me going out of my mind Never met a guy like you before You make me feel special inside I think I m in love Boy I think that I m in love with you Got me doin silly things when it comes to you Boy I think that I m in love with you I ve been telling all my friends what I feel for you Boy I think that I m in love with you Got me doin silly things when it comes to you Boy I think that I m in love with you Got me telling all my friends what I feel for you
