 I m steady tryna find the motive Why I do what I do Freedom ain t getting no closer No matter how far I go My car is stolen no registration Cops patrollin and now they done stop me And I get locked up They won t let me out They won t let me out They won t let me out No they won t let me out They won t let me out They won t let me out They won t let me out No they won t let me out Heading uptown to re up Back with a couple keys Corner block s on fire Undercovers dressed as fiends Making so much money Product s moving fast Put away the stash And as I sold the last bag Fucked around and got locked up They won t let me out They won t let me out They won t let me out No they won t let me out They won t let me out They won t let me out They won t let me out No they won t let me out Cause visitation no longer comes by Seems like they forgot about me Commissary is getting empty My cell mates getting food without me Can t wait to get out And move forward with my life Got a family that loves me And wants me to do right But instead I m here locked up They won t let me out They won t let me out They won t let me out No they won t let me out They won t let me out They won t let me out They won t let me out No they won t let me out Maybe a visit Send me some magazines Send me some money orders Maybe a visit baby Cause I m locked up they won t let me out Wheres my lawyer I m locked up they won t let me out no Get me outta here I m locked up they won t let me out They won t let me out Baby I m locked up they won t let me out no Where s my niggas On the lock down Damn I m locked up they won t let me out I m locked up they won t let me out Ohhh they won t let me out Can you please accept my phone calls Cause I m locked up locked up locked up
