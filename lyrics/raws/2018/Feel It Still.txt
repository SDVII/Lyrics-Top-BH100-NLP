Can't keep my hands to myself Think I'll dust 'em off put 'em back up on the shelf In case my little baby girl is in need Am I coming out of left field  Ooh woo I'm a rebel just for kicks now I been feeling it since 1966 now Might be over now but I feel it still Ooh woo I'm a rebel just for kicks now Let me kick it like it's 1986 now Might be over now but I feel it still Got another mouth to feed  Leave it with a baby sitter mama call the grave digger Gone with the fallen leaves Am I coming out of left field  Ooh woo I'm a rebel just for kicks now I been feeling it since 1966 now Might've had your fill but you feel it still Ooh woo I'm a rebel just for kicks now Let me kick it like it's 1986 now Might be over now but I feel it still We could fight a war for peace Give in to that easy living Goodbye to my hopes and dreams Start flipping for my enemies We could wait until the walls come down It's time to give a little to the kids in the middle But oh until it falls won't bother me Is it coming  Is it coming  Is it coming  Is it coming  Is it coming  Is it coming back  Ooh woo I'm a rebel just for kicks yeah Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse now Might be over now but I feel it still Ooh woo I'm a rebel just for kicks now I've been feeling it since 1966 now Might be over now but I feel it still Ooh woo I'm a rebel just for kicks now Let me kick it like it's 1986 now Might be over now but I feel it still Might've had your fill but I feel it still
