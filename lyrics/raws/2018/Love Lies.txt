Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe mmm I need a lover to trust tell me you're on my side Are you down for the ride  It's not easy for someone to catch my eye But I've been waitin' for you for my whole damn life For my whole lifetime Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it  I see you're focused yeah you're so independent  It's hard for me to open up I'll admit it  You've got some shit to say and I'm here to listen So baby tell me where your love lies Waste the day and spend the night Underneath the sunrise Show me where your love lies I've been so into your mystery Is it because of our history  Are you into me  When it feels so good but it's bad for you Can't say I don't want it 'cause I know I do Come on over I need your company Cravin' that synergy Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it  I see you're focused yeah you're so independent  It's hard for me to open up I'll admit it  You've got some shit to say and I'm here to listen So baby tell me where your love lies Waste the day and spend the night Underneath the sunrise Show me where your love lies Tell me where your love lies Waste the day and spend the night Underneath the sunrise Show me where your love lies If you're down don't hide it Feelin' me you don't gotta deny it Baby you gon' make me overnight it Tell me are you down  If you're down don't hide it  Feelin' me you don't gotta deny it  Baby you gon' make me overnight it Tell me are you down   Tell me where your love lies  Waste the day and spend the night  Underneath the sunrise  Show me where your love lies  Tell me where your love lies  Waste the day and spend the night  Underneath the sunrise  Show me where your love lies
