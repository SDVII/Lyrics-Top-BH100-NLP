Heaven only knows where you've been But I don't really need to know I know where you're gonna go On my heart where you're resting your head And you just look so beautiful It's like you were an angel Can I stop the flow of time  Can I swim in your divine  Cause I don't think I'd ever leave this place Oh turn the lights turn the lights down low Yeah now I'm feeling you breathing slow oh 'Cause baby we're just reckless kids Trying to find an island in the flood Oh turn the lights turn the lights down low oh Under heavy skies in the rain You're dancing in your bare feet Just like we're in a movie Grab my hand and we're chasing the train Catch you looking back at me Running through a cloud of steam Can I stop the flow of time  Can I swim in your divine  Cause I don't think I'd ever leave this place Oh turn the lights turn the lights down low Yeah now I'm feeling you breathing slow oh 'Cause baby we're just reckless kids Trying to find an island in the flood Oh turn the lights turn the lights down low oh And I will give you everything baby But can you feel this energy  Take it You can have the best of me baby And I will give you anything Can you feel this energy  Take it You can have the best of me baby Oh turn the lights turn the lights down low Yeah now I'm feeling you breathing slow oh Oh turn the lights turn the lights down low Yeah now I'm feeling you breathing slow oh 'Cause baby we're just reckless kids Trying to find an island in the flood Oh turn the lights turn the lights down low oh
