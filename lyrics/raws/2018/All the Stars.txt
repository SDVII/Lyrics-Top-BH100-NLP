Love let's talk about love Is it anything and everything you hoped for  Or do the feeling haunt you   I know the feeling haunt you  This may be the night that my dreams might let me know All the stars are closer All the stars are closer All the stars are closer This may be the night that my dreams might let me know All the stars are closer All the stars are closer All the stars are closer Tell me what you gon' do to me Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me You can bring a bullet bring a sword bring a morgue But you can't bring the truth to me Fuck you and all your expectations I don't even want your congratulations I recognize your false confidence And calculated promises all in your conversation I hate people that feel entitled Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you Oh you important  You the moral to the story  You endorsin'  Mothafucka I don't even like you Corrupt a man's heart with a gift That's how you find out who you dealin' with A small percentage who I'm buildin' with I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin' On my momma that's the realest shit Love let's talk about love Is it anything and everything you hoped for  Or do the feeling haunt you   I know the feeling haunt you  This may be the night that my dreams might let me know All the stars are closer All the stars are closer All the stars are closer This may be the night that my dreams might let me know All the stars are closer All the stars are closer All the stars are closer Skin covered in ego Get to talkin' I get involved like a rebound No control no off switch And the way that you bringin' me down It's a turn on get it away from me Know you mean wrong keep away from me And it's all wrong get it away from me yeah I just cry for no reason I just pray for no reason I give thanks for the life for the day For the hours and another life breathin' I did it all 'cause it feel good You'd leave it all if it feel bad Better live your life we were runnin' out of time Love let's talk about love Is it anything and everything you hoped for  Or do the feeling haunt you   I know the feeling haunt you  This may be the night that my dreams might let me know All the stars are closer All the stars are closer All the stars are closer This may be the night that my dreams might let me know All the stars are closer All the stars are closer All the stars are closer
