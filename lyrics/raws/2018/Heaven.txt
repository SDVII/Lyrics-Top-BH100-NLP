This is perfect Come kiss me one more time I couldn't dream this up Even if I tried You and me in this moment Feels like magic don't it  I'm right where I wanna be Everybody's talking about heaven like they just can't wait to go Saying how it's gonna be so good so beautiful Lying next to you in this bed with you I ain't convinced Cause I don't know how I don't know how heaven heaven Could be better than this I swear you're an angel Sent to this world What did I do right to deserve you girl  I could stay here forever I'd be fine if we never had to even leave this room Everybody's talking about heaven like they just can't wait to go Saying how it's gonna be so good so beautiful Lying next to you in this bed with you I ain't convinced Cause I don't know how I don't know how heaven heaven Could be better than this Could be better than this Everybody's talking about heaven like they just can't wait to go Saying how it's gonna be so good so beautiful Lying next to you in this bed with you I ain't convinced Cause I don't know how I don't know how heaven heaven Could be better than this  Could be better than this  I swear this is perfect Come kiss me one more time
