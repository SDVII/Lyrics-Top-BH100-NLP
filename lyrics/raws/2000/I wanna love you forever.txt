 You set my soul at ease Chased darkness out of view Left your desperate spell on me Say you feel it too I know you do I ve got so much more to give This can t die I yearn to live Pour yourself all over me And I ll cherish every drop here on my knees I wanna love you forever And this is all I m asking of you 10 000 lifetimes together Is that so much for you to do Cause from the moment that I saw your face And felt the fire in your sweet embrace I swear I knew I m gonna love you forever My mind fails to understand What my heart tells me to do And I d give up all I have just to be with you And that would do I ve always been taught to win And I never thought I d fall Be at the mercy of a man I ve never been Now I only want to be right where you are I wanna love you forever And this is all I m asking of you 10 000 lifetimes together Is that so much for you to do Cause from the moment that I saw your face And felt the fire in your sweet embrace I swear I knew I m gonna love you forever In my life I ve learned that heaven never waits no Let s take this now before it s gone like yesterday Cause when I m with you there s nowhere else That I would ever want to be no I m breathing for the next second I can feel you Loving me I m gonna love I wanna lover you forever And this is all I m asking of you 10 000 lifetimes together Is that so much for you to do Cause from the moment that I saw your face And felt the fire in your sweet embrace I swear I knew I m gonna love you forever forever Ooh I wanna love you forever Everyday everyday 10 000 lifetimes together
