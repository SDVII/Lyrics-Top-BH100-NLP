 You keep telling me you want me Hold me close all through the night I know that deep inside you need me No one else can make it right Don t you try to hide the secret I can see it in your eyes You said the words without speaking Now I m gonna make you mine Give me just one night una noche A moment to be by your side Give me just one night una noche I ll give you the time of your life Your rustic passion makes me crazy You existance makes me wild I wanna loosen up your feelings See what s hiding inside Just give me one night una noche A moment to be by your side Give me just one night una noche I ll give you the time of your life Girl Aye que rico me pone loca Como te mueves como me toca Tu movimiento tu sentimiento Si yo te quiero te doy la noche Toda la noche Aye vamos Give me just one night A moment to be by your side Give me just one night I ll give you the time of your life Give me just one night Give me just one night una noche A moment to be by your side Give me just one night una noche I ll give you the time of your life Come on come on come on now baby Give me just one night una noche A moment to be by your side Give me just one night una noche I ll give you the time of your life Ooh yeah
