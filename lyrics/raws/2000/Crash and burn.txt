 When you feel all alone And the world has turned its back on you Give me a moment please To tame your wild wild heart I know you feel like The walls are closing in on you It s hard to find relief And people can be so cold When darkness is upon your door And you feel like you can t talk anymore Let me be the one you call If you jump I ll break your fall Lift you up and fly with you into the night If you need to fall apart I can mend a broken heart If you need to crash and burn you re not alone When you feel all alone And a loyal friend is hard to find You re caught in a one way street With the monsters in your head When hopes and dreams are far away And you feel like you can t face the day Let me be the one you call If you jump I ll break your fall Lift you up and fly with you into the night If you need to fall apart I can mend a broken heart If you need to crash and burn you re not alone Because there has always been heartache and pain And when its over you ll breathe again You ll breathe again When you feel all alone And when the world has turned it s back on you Give me a moment please To tame your wild wild heart Let me be the one you call If you jump I ll break your fall Lift you up and fly with you into the night If you need to fall apart I can mend a broken heart If you need to crash and burn you re not alone Let me be the one you call If you jump I ll break your fall Lift you up and fly with you into the night If you need to fall apart I can mend a broken heart If you need to crash and burn you re not alone
