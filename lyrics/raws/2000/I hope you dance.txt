 I hope you never lose your sense of wonder You get your fill to eat But always keep that hunger May you never take one single breath for granted God forbid love ever leave you empty handed I hope you still feel small When you stand beside the ocean Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens Promise me that you ll give faith a fighting chance And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance I hope you dance I hope you dance I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance Never settle for the path of least resistance Living might mean taking chances But they re worth taking Loving might be a mistake But it s worth making Don t let some Hell bent heart leave you bitter When you come close to selling out Reconsider Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance I hope you dance I hope you dance I hope you dance I hope you dance Time is a wheel in constant motion Always rolling us along Tell me who wants to look back on their years And wonder where those years have gone I hope you still feel small When you stand beside the ocean Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens Promise me that you ll give faith a fighting chance And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance Dance I hope you dance I hope you dance I hope you dance I hope you dance I hope you dance Time is a wheel in constant motion Always rolling us along Tell me who wants to look back on their years And wonder where those years have gone
