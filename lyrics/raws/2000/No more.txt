Ooh babe oh girl No more no more Bounce baby bounce baby You can move uh Check it out Baby relax sit back and chill Just give me a second And let me tell you how I feel Cause all around town you ve been steppin out Runnin your mouth about What made you think I wouldn t find out Wasn t I there for you Truly cared for you Maybe my love was just too good Could ve had it good now the love is gone And went back to your hood with the 54 11 s on 1 Does he lace you with the finer things Does he make ya wanna scream his name Does he hit it from the front to back Did you let him break it down like that Should ve told me the love was gone Never thought that you d do me wrong Girl I thought that your love was strong Til I saw you in another man s arms 2 No more shopping sprees No more late night creeps No more VIP No more dough We can t even kick it no more Repeat 2 I saw you on the Ave and I laughed In the backseat beeeze spilling Henney in his lap Thought it was me that you was all about But I m having doubts Cause I see you tryna play me out But when the brother called the crib with beef Didn t I represent you When I caught him in the streets So let me get the keys to Lex and no more checks And no more hanging baguettes around your neck babe Repeat 1 Repeat 2 No more I want no more Baby I want no more Repeat 2 till end
