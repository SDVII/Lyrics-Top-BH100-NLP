 Games changes and fears When will they go from here When will they stop I believe that fate has brought us here And we should be together babe But we re not I play it off but I m dreaming of you And I ll keep my cool but I m feigning I try to say goodbye and I choke I try to walk away and I stumble Though I try to hide it it s clear My world crumbles when you are not near Goodbye and I choke I try to walk away and I stumble Though I try to hide it it s clear My world crumbles when you are not near I may appear to be free But I m just a prisoner of your love And I may seem alright and smile when you leave But my smiles are just a front Just a front hey I play it off but I m dreaming of you And I ll keep my cool but I m feigning I try to say goodbye and I choke I try to walk away and I stumble Though I try to hide it it s clear My world crumbles when you are not near Goodbye and I choke I try to walk away and I stumble Though I try to hide it it s clear My world crumbles when you are not near Here is my confession May I be your possession Boy I need your touch Your love kisses and such With all my might I try But this I can t deny Deny I play it off but I m dreaming of you I ll keep my cool but I m feigning I try to say goodbye and I choke I try to walk away and I stumble Though I try to hide it it s clear My world crumbles when you are not near Goodbye and I choke I try to walk away and I stumble Though I try to hide it it s clear My world crumbles when you are not near Goodbye and I choke I try to walk away and I stumble Though I try to hide it it s clear My world crumbles when you are not near Yeah yeah yeah Yeah yeah
