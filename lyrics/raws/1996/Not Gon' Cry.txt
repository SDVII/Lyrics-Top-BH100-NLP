 While all the time that I was loving you You were busy loving yourself I would stop breathing if you told me to Now you re busy loving someone else Eleven years out of my life Besides the kids I have nothing to show Wasted my years a fool of a wife I should have left your ass a long time ago Well I m not gon cry I m not gon cry I m not gon shed no tears No I m not gon cry It s not the time Cause you re not worth my tears Well I m not gon cry I m not gon cry I m not gon shed no tears No I m not gon cry It s not the time Cause you re not worth my tears I was your lover and your secretary Working every day of the week Was at the job when no one else was there Helping you get on your feet Eleven years I ve sacrificed And you can leave me at the drop of a dime Swallowed my fears stood by your side I should have left your ass a thousand times Well I m not gon cry I m not gon cry I m not gon shed no tears No I m not gon cry It s not the time Cause you re not worth my tears Well I m not gon cry I m not gon cry I m not gon shed no tears No I m not gon cry It s not the time Cause you re not worth my tears I know there are no guarantees In love you take your chances But somehow it seems unfair to me Look at the circumstances Through sickness and health til death do us part Those were the words that we said from our hearts So now when you say that you re leaving me I don t get that part I was your lover and your secretary Working every day of the week Was at the job when no one else was there Helping you get on your feet Eleven years I ve sacrificed And you can leave me at the drop of a dime Swallowed my fears stood by your side I should have left your ass a thousand times Well I m not gon cry I m not gon cry I m not gon shed no tears No I m not gon cry It s not the time Cause you re not worth my tears Well I m not gon cry I m not gon cry I m not gon shed no tears No I m not gon cry It s not the time Cause you re not worth my tears Well I m not gon cry I m not gon cry I m not gon shed no tears No I m not gon cry It s not the time Cause you re not worth my tears Well I m not gon cry I m not gon cry I m not gon shed no tears No I m not gon cry It s not the time Cause you re not worth my tears
