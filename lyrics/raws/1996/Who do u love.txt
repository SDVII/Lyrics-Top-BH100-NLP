Hmm Oh oh Ooh ooh Oh yeah Oh oh Last night I slept alone I stayed at home For the first time since you ve been gone baby No friends to understand to lend a helping hand To ease the greatest pain I ve ever known How you walked away so easily still remains a mystery to me Don t you remember that you promised me Yes you promised me that you d never leave boy But you went away baby and it s such a shame How could you turn your back on me Oh If you don t want me If you don t need me Tell me who do you love boy If you don t want me If you don t need me I gave gave everything a man could ever need I was there whenever you would call me baby But somehow your feelings changed you don t act the same I guess you re not the man that I once knew at all How you walked away so easily still remains a mystery to me Don t you remember that you promised me Yes you promised me that you d never leave boy Now the love is gone baby tell me what went wrong How could you leave me hanging on Oh baby If you don t want me Oh oh oh Tell me who do you love Yeah If you don t want me If you don t need me Tell me yeah Ooh oh If you don t want me If you don t need me Tell me who do who do you love boy If you don t want me Oh no Tell me who do you love I once was blind but baby now I see yeah That I m not the one who can fill your every need I painted a picture so clear it s reality Now I know yes I know that you re not the one for me Oh baby Oh yeah Who do you love baby If you don t want me If you don t need me How could you walk away from me Baby you promised you d never leave Slept alone since you ve been gone the greatest pain I ve ever known Oh baby oh baby oh yeah Oh oh baby If you don t love me Tell me tell me who do you love boy Oh baby If you don t need me
