 Sorry I never told you All I wanted to say And now it s too late to hold you Cause you ve flown away so far away Never had I imagined Living without your smile Feeling and knowing you hear me It keeps me alive alive And I know you re shining down on me from Heaven Like so many friends we ve lost along the way And I know eventually we ll be together One sweet day Picture a little scene in Heaven Darling I never showed you Assumed you d always be there I thought you d always be there I I took your presence for granted But I always cared And I miss the love we shared And I know you re shining down on me from Heaven Like so many friends we ve lost along the way And I know eventually we ll be together One sweet day Picture a little scene in Heaven Yeah yeah Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep You will always listen as I pray And I know you re shining down on me from Heaven Like so many friends we ve lost along the way And I know eventually we ll be together One sweet day And I know you re shining down on me from Heaven Like so many friends we ve lost along the way And I know eventually we ll be together One sweet day Sorry I never told you All I wanted to say
