I didn t ask they shouldn t have told me At first I laughed but now It s sinking in fast whatever they sold me But baby I don t want to take advice from fools I ll just figure everything is cool Until I hear it from you It gets hard when memory s faded And who gets what the say It s likely they re just jealous and jaded Or maybe I don t want to take advice from fools I ll just figure everything is cool Until I hear it from you Until I hear it from you I can t let it get me off Or break up my train of thought As far as I know nothing s wrong Until I hear it from you Still thinking about not living without it Outside looking in til we re talking about Not stepping around it Maybe I don t want to take advice from fools I ll just figure everything is cool Until I hear it from you Until I hear it from you Until I hear it from you Until I hear it from you oh no It s gonna carry on You oh no It s gonna carry on Til I hear it from you Til I hear it from you
