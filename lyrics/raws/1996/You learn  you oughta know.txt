I want you to know that I am happy for you I wish nothing but the best for you both An older version of me Is she perverted like me Would she go down on you in a theater Does she speak eloquently And would she have your baby I m sure she d make a really excellent mother Cause the love that you gave that we made Wasn t able to make it enough for you To be open wide no And every time you speak her name Does she know how you told me You d hold me until you died Til you died but you re still alive And I m here to remind you Of the mess you left when you went away It s not fair to deny me Of the cross I bear that you gave to me You you you oughta know You seem very well things look peaceful I m not quite as well I thought you should know Did you forget about me Mr Duplicity I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner It was a slap in the face How quickly I was replaced And are you thinking of me when you fuck her Cause the love that you gave that we made Wasn t able to make it enough for you To be open wide no And every time you speak her name Does she know how you told me You d hold me until you died Til you died but you re still alive And I m here to remind you Of the mess you left when you went away It s not fair to deny me Of the cross I bear that you gave to me You you you oughta know Cause the joke that you laid in the bed That was me and I m not gonna fade As soon as you close your eyes and you know it And every time I scratch my nails Down someone else s back I hope you feel it Well can you feel it And I m here to remind you Of the mess you left when you went away It s not fair to deny me Of the cross I bear that you gave to me You you you oughta know
