 all this time i know someday you would need to find something that you left behind something i can not give you all these tears and like a night love disappears but hearts are good for souvenirs and memories are forever all this time all in all i have no regrets the sun still shines the sun still sets and the heart forgives the heart forgets though what will i do now with all this time one more kiss even though it has come to this i will close my eyes and make a wish hoping you will remember all this time all in all i have no regrets the sun still shines the sun still sets and the heart forgives the heart forgets though what will i do now with all this time say goodbye apart we will make another try but do not be sorry if you cry i will be crying too all this day all this time all in all i have no regrets the sun still shines the sun still sets and the heart forgives the heart forgets though what will i do now with all this time what will i do now with all this time
