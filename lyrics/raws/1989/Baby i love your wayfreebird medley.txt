Shadows grow so long before my eyes And they re moving across the page Suddenly the day turns into night Far away from the city But don t hesitate Cause your love Your love won t wait oh no no Baby I love your way every day Wanna tell you I love your way every day Wanna be with you night and day Hey I love your way If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me For I must be traveling on now There s so many places I ve gotta see But if I stayed here with you girl Things just wouldn t be the same Cause I m as free as a bird now And this bird will never change And this bird will never change Shadows grow so long before my eyes With the help of some fireflies I wonder how they have the power to shine I can see them under the pines But don t hesitate Cause your love Your love won t wait Ooh baby I love your way Wanna tell you I love your way Oh baby I love your way Every day now Ooh wanna tell you I love your way I love your way Ooh baby I love your way Give me you way Wanna tell you I love your way Ooh baby I love your ways Ooh baby I love your way Ooh wanna tell you I love your way Ooh baby I love your way Ooh wanna tell you I love your way Ooh baby I love your way
