If you don t know me by now You will never never never know me All the things that we ve been through You should understand me like I understand you Now girl I know the difference between right and wrong I ain t gonna do nothing to break up our happy home Don t get so excited when I come home a little late at night Cause we only act like children when we argue fuss and fight If you don t know me by now You will never never never know me If you don t know by now You will never never never know me We ve all got our own funny moods I ve got mine woman you ve got yours too Just trust in me like I trust in you As long as we ve been together it should be so easy to do Just get yourself together or we might as well say goodbye What good is a love affair when we can t see eye to eye If you don t know me by now You will never never never know me
