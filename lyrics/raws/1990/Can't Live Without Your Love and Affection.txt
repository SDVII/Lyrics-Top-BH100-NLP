 Mmm just like an angel Seems like forever that she s been on my mind But nothing has changed She thinks I m a waste of her time she don t know what she s missing Can t she see I ll never give up the fight I ll do all I can Till she understands my desire I ve been on the outside looking in Let me into your heart oh There s nothing on earth that should keep us apart Baby I can t live without your love and affection I can t face another night on my own I d give up my pride to save me from being alone Cause I can t live without your love Mmm your love Here for an answer And wonder if tomorrow will be like yesterday I ll keep holding on Can t go on living this way baby I ve been on the outside looking in Bring my tears to an end oh I realize there s no use for me to pretend Oh yeah I can t live without your love and affection I can t face another night on my own I d give up my pride to save me from being alone Cause I can t live without your love I d put my arms around you I d find the strength to tell you That I can t live without your I can t live without your love and affection I can t face another night on my own I d give up my pride to save me from being alone Baby I can t live without your love and affection I just can t go on this way anymore As hard as I try there s one thing that I know for sure I can t live without your love I can t live without your love baby Oh I can t live without your love Oh I can t live without your love
