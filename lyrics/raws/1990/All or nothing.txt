The game of love is to live it up And baby not too high Don t you know if you wanna get down with Mister P You gotta go and let your backbone slide What feeling when you push it up push it down You gotta push it up push it down Feel good George Michael or Marvin Gaye It still is the same in you Baby don t tease Ooh just please cause you know it s just me and you All or nothing push it s got to be Something s gotta show when you re livin under heat All or nothing push girl let it be Take it from the pro who s rockin to the beat I m under heat oh baby please take it slow Give me some time and maybe our love will grow I want to suit you baby and make it right Take it from me babe I wanna rock all night If it s good for me it s good for you You gotta never let your mood get dry Just keep it wet and my seven forty jet Is pushing right on high George Michael or Marvin Gaye It still is the same in you Baby don t tease Ooh just please cause you know it s just me and you All or nothing push it s got to be Something s gotta show when you re livin under heat All or nothing push girl let it be Take it from the pro who s rockin to the beat I m under heat oh baby please take it slow Give me some time and maybe our love will grow I want to suit you baby and make it right Take it from me babe I wanna rock all night Push it up push it down Push it where it feels real good On my lips my sweet bumble bee Sting me like I knew you could All or nothing push it s got to be Something s gotta show when you re lyin under me Oh oh nothin girl let it be Take it from the pro who s rockin to the beat
