 Love come quick Love come in a hurry There are thieves in the temple tonight They don t care where they kick Just as long as they hurt you There are thieves in the temple tonight Love if you re there come save me From all this cold despair I can hang when you re around But I ll surely die If you re not there Love come quick Love come in a hurry There are thieves in the temple tonight I feel like I m looking for my soul Like a poor man looking for gold There are thieves in the temple tonight Voices from the sky say rely on your best friend to pull you through But even if I wanted to I couldn t really truly because my only friend is you Come on There are thieves in the temple tonight Kicking me in my heart tearing me all apart Because me and you could have been a work of art Thieves in the temple Baby don t you know I m holding on The best that I can Love please help me be The better man Better than the thieves in the temple In the temple tonight Oh thieves in the temple tonight Hurt me Love come quick Love come in a hurry There are thieves in the temple tonight Thieves in the temple You said you loved me You said I was your friend You were supposed to take care of me Thieves in the temple You lie Love come in a hurry Thieves in the temple
