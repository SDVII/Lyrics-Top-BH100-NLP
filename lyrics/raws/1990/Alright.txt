 Seeing that your love s true Never I ll doubt you My heart belongs to you That s alright with me Worlds could end around me So in love that I can t see You and me were meant to be That s alright with me Friends come and friends may go My friend you re real I know True self you have shown You re alright with me Through thick and thick to thin I ll love you til the end You know it s true my friend You re alright with me Catch a fallin star that shines Make a wish clap three times Dreams come true it s in the mind That s alright with me Your wish is my command Never thought I d fall in love again Again with my best friend That s alright with me Friends come and friends may go My friend you re real I know True self you have shown You re alright with me Through thick and thick to thin I ll love you till the end You know it s true my friend You re alright with me Always and everlasting This love is just not passing We re happy as can be Alright with me Friends come and friends may go My friend you re real I know True self you have shown You re alright with me Through thick and thick to thin I ll love you till the end You know it s true my friend You re alright with me Now be it thick as a milkshake Or thin as a cornflake I love you to death but I ain t Pressed with a heartbreak And anyway who cares about what Other people talk about I rather hear it from the horse s mouth See I believe in being believed in No love life for low ties is all paper thin But watch for the trickery Some people are slippery They appear making history Disappear like a mystery It ain t your fault But you re a walking bank vault The people of life make life bitter as salt They say what they want to say Play how they want to play But you got to live your life day by day In order to survive you overlook and overcome Selfish attitude or lack of Gratitude from the dumb It ain t easy being you and Everything you want to be But whatever you do is alright with me The bon diddlely dee The overweight lover MC the cap The rapper hand clap foot tap Heavy D dee dee dee
