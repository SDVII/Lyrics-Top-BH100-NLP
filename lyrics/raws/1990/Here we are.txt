Here we are Face to face We forget Time and place Hold me now Don t let go Though it hurts and we both know The time we spend together s gonna fly And everything you do to me Is gonna feel so right Baby when you re loving me I feel like I could cry Cause there s nothing I can do To keep from loving you No no no no no Here we are All alone Trembling hearts Beating strong Reaching out Breathless kiss I never thought could feel like this I want to stop the time from passing by I wanna close my eyes And feel your lips are touching mine Baby when you re close to me I want you more each time And there s nothing I can do To keep from loving you There s nothing I can do I m helpless in your arms Oh baby what you do I m in love This is it There s no turning back this time No no no Here we are Once again But this time we re only friends Funny world sometimes lies Become the game When loves the prize And though no one knows What s going on inside And all the love I feel for you Is something I should hide When I have you close to me The feeling s so sublime But there s nothing I can do To keep from loving you No no no Can t keep from loving you baby No no no There s nothing I can do my baby Can t keep from loving you
