 Friday night you and your boys went out to eat Then they hung out But you came home around three yes you did If six of y all went out Then four of you were really cheap Cause only two of you had dinner I found your credit card receipt It s not right But it s okay I m gonna make it anyway Pack your bags up and leave Don t you dare come running back to me It s not right But it s okay I m gonna make it anyway Close the door behind you Leave your key I d rather be alone than unhappy I ll pack your bags so you can leave town for a week The phone rings and then you look at me Why d you turned and look at me You said it was one of your friends down on 54th St So why did 213 show up on your Caller I D I ve been through all of this before I ve been through all this before So how could you think Don t think about it don t think about it That I would stand around and take some more Get goin get goin Things are gonna change Things are gon change baby Cause I don t want to be a fool anymore You don t stand no chance boy That s why you have to leave So don t turn around to see my face Don t you turn around There s no more fears and tears left for you to see Was it really worth you going out like that See I m moving on And I refuse to turn back See all of this time I thought I had somebody down for Whitney It turns out you were making a fool of me It s not right But it s okay I m gonna make it anyway Pack your bags Up and leave Don t you dare come running back to me It s not right But it s okay I m gonna make it anyway Close the door behind you Leave your key I d rather be alone than unhappy
