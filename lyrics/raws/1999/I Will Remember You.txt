 I will remember you Will you remember me Don t let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories Remember the good times that we had I let them slip away from us when things got bad How clearly I first saw you smilin in the sun Want to feel your warmth upon me I want to be the one I will remember you Will you remember me Don t let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories I m so tired but I can t sleep Standin on the edge of something much too deep It s funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word We are screaming inside oh we can t be heard That I will remember you Will you remember me Don t let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories So afraid to love you But more afraid to lose Clinging to a past that doesn t let me choose Where once there was a darkness Deep and endless night You gave me everything you had oh you gave me life And I will remember you Will you remember me Don t let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories And I will remember you Will you remember me Don t let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories Weep not for the memories
