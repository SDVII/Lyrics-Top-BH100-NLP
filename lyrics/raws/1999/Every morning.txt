 Every morning there s a halo hanging From the corner of my girlfriend s four post bed I know it s not mine but I ll see if I can use it for The weekend or a one night stand Couldn t understand How to work it out Once again as predicted left my broken heart open And you ripped it out Something s got me reeling Stopped me from believing Turn me around again Said that we can do it You know I wanna do it again Ohh Ohh Ohh Every morning there s a heartache hanging From the corner of my girlfriend s four post bed I know it s not mine and I know she thinks she loves me But I never can believe what she said Something so deceiving when you stop believing Turn me around again Said we couldn t do it You know I wanna do it again Ohh Ohh Ohh She always rights the wrong For me Baby She always rights the wrong For me Every morning there s a halo hanging From the corner of my girlfriend s four post bed I know it s not mine but I ll see if I can use it for The weekend or a one night stand Every morning Every morning when I wake up Every morning Every morning Every morning Every morning Every morning when I wake up Every morning
