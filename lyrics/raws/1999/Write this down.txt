 I never saw the end in sight fools are kind of blind Thought everything was going alright but I was running out of time Because you had one foot out the door I swear I didn t see But if you re really going away here s some final words from me Baby write this down take a little note to remind you in case you didn t know Tell yourself I love you and I don t want you to go write this down Take my words read them every day keep them close by don t you let them fade away So you ll remember what I forgot to say write this down I ll sign it at the bottom of the page I ll swear under oath Cause every single word is true and I think you need to know So use it as a bookmark stick it on your refrigerator door Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel where you ll see it for sure You can find a chisel I can find a stone Folks will be reading these words long after we re gone Oh I love you and I don t want you to go baby write this down
