That s right Life is funny ain t it Sometimes you can end up with Somebody you really don t wanna be with And others left to figure it out Check it She was more than a women a goddess for all it seems All I ever needed was her right here loving me For a while we were cool and the groovin love was on But I still remember how it felt when our love was gone In a tattered picture book Was a photograph she took years ago Secret memories in her mind How could love be so unkind Heartbreak time Faded pictures in a broken glass Like a mirror revealing What the woman is feeling Was it someone from a distant past Cause it s breaking my heart To watch her stare into the glass As she turned through the pages the tears rolled down her face I could see her reminiscing why her life had to be this way Then she stopped and she came to a page where her diary ends To smell the scent of an old rose from her lover I suppose In a tattered picture book Was a photograph she took years ago Secret memories in her mind How could love be so unkind Heartbreak time Faded pictures in a broken glass Like a mirror revealing What the woman is feeling Was it someone from a distant past Cause it s breaking my heart To watch her stare into the glass Just keep spinning As she stares into the glass I ll be waiting Cause she s lost inside the past Faded pictures in a broken glass Like a mirror revealing What the woman is feeling Was it someone from a distant past Cause it s breaking my heart To watch her stare into the glass Faded pictures in a broken glass
