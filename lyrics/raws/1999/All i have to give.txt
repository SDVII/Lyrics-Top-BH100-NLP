 I don t know what he does to make you cry But I ll be there to make you smile I don t have a fancy car To get to you I d walk a thousand miles I don t care if he buys you nice things Does his gifts come from the heart I don t know but if you were my girl I d make it so we d never be apart But my love is all I have to give Without you I don t think I could live I wish I could give the world to you But love is all I have to give When you talk does it seem like he s not Even listening to a word you say That s okay babe just tell me your problems I ll try my best to kiss them all away Does he leave when you need him the most Does his friends get all your time Baby please I m on my knees Praying for the day that you ll be mine But my love is all I have to give Without you I don t think I could live I wish I could give the world to you But love is all I have to give Kevin Hey girl I don t want you to cry no more inside All the money in the world Could never add up to And I will give it to you All I can give all I can give Everything I have is for you But love is all I have to give But my love is all I have to give Without you I don t think I could live I wish I could give the world to you But love is all I have to give But my love is all I have to give Without you I don t think I could live I wish I could give the world to you But love is all I have to give But my love is all I have to give Without you I don t think I could live I wish I could give the world to you But love is all I have to give
