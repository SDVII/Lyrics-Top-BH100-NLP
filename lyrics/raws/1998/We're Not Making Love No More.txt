 Sure I ve been in love a time or two But in the end I still chose you No one could ever make me feel this way That s why it s killing me what we re going through Somehow thought tween me and you Our love would stand the test of time and never ever fade But we re not making love no more We re not even trying to change Tell me how it slips away Does it ever stay the same We don t even talk no more We ve ran out of words to say Tell me it don t have to change Won t it ever stay the same Girl I know that things aren t going right But don t you think it deserves a fight A love like ours don t happen everyday And we re losing it right as we speak And if we don t wake up it s a memory A time gone past a love that sailed away I dream of lovers past and I see a girl so sad cause She lost the only man she loved He went away Well it s not too late for us To change
