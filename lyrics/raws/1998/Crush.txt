 Ah Crush Ah See you blowing me a kiss It doesn t take a scientist To understand what s going on baby If you see something in my eye Let s not overanalyze Don t go too deep with it baby So let it be what it ll be Don t make a fuss And get crazy over you and me Here s what I do I ll play it loose Not like we have a date with destiny It s just a little crush Not like I faint every time we touch It s just some little thing Not like everything I do Depends on you Sha la la la Sha la la la It s raising my adrenaline You re banging on a heart of tin Please don t make too much of it baby Say that we re forevermore That s not what I m looking for All I can commit to is maybe So let it be what it ll be Don t make a fuss And get crazy over you and me Here s what I do I ll play it loose Not like we have a date with destiny Oh ohhh It s just a little crush Not like I faint every time we touch It s just some little thing Not like everything I do Depends on you Sha la la la Sha la la la Vanilla skies White picket fences in your eyes A vision of you and me It s just a little crush Not like I faint every time we touch It s just some little thing Not like everything I do Depends on you Sha la la la Sha la la la Not like I faint every time we touch It s just some little thing Not like everything I do depends on you Sha la la la Sha la la la Not like I faint every time we touch It s just some little thing Not like everything I do
