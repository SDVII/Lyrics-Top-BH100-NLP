You took your coat off and stood in the rain You re always crazy like that And I watched from my window Always felt I was outside looking in on you You re always the mysterious one with Dark eyes and careless hair You were fashionably sensitive But too cool to care You stood in my doorway with nothing to say Besides some comment on the weather Well in case you failed to notice In case you failed to see This is my heart bleeding before you This is me down on my knees and These foolish games are tearing me apart And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart You re breaking my heart You re always brilliant in the morning Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee Your philosophies on art Baroque moved you You loved Mozart and you d talk of your loved ones As I clumsily strummed my guitar You d teach me of honest things Things that were daring things that were clean Things that knew what an honest dollar did bring I hid my soiled hands behind my back Somewhere along the line I must ve got Off track with you Well excuse me guess I ve mistaken you for somebody else Somebody who gave a damn Somebody more like myself You took your coat off You stood in the rain You re always crazy like that
