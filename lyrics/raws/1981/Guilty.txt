Shadows falling baby we stand alone Out on the street anybody you meet Got a heartache of their own  Make it a crime to be lonely or sad  You got a reason for livin' You battle on with the love you're livin' on You gotta be mine We take it away It's got to be night and day Just a matter of time And we got nothing to be guilty of Our love will climb any mountain near or far we are And we never let it end We are devotion And we got nothing to be sorry for Our love is one in a million Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky I don't wanna hear your goodbye Pulses racing darling How grand we are Little by little we meet in the middle There's danger in the dark  Make it a crime to be out in the cold  You got a reason for livin' You battle on with the love you're buildin' on You gotta be mine We take it away It's gotta be night and day Just a matter of time Don't wanna hear your goodbye I don't wanna hear your
