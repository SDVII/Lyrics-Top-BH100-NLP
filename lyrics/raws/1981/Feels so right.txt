Whisper to me softly Breathe words upon my skin No one's near and listening So please don't say goodbye Just hold me close and love me Press your lips to mine Mmm feels so right feels so right Lying here beside you I hear the echoes of your sighs Promise me you'll stay with me And keep me warm tonight Your body feels so gentle And my passion rises high You're loving me so easy Your wish is my command
