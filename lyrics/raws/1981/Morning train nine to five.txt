I wake up every mornin' I stumble out of bed Stretchin' and yawnin' another day ahead It seems to last forever and time goes slowly by Till babe and me's together then it starts to fly 'Cause the moment that he's with me time can take a flight The moment that he's with me everything's alright Night time is the right time we make love Then it's his and my time we take off My baby takes the morning train He works from nine to five and then He takes another home again To find me waitin' for him My baby takes the morning train He works from nine to five and then He takes another home again To find me waitin' for him He takes me to a movie or to a restaurant To go slow dancing anything I want Only when he's with me I catch light Only when he gives me makes me feel alright My baby takes the morning train He works from nine to five and then He takes another home again To find me waitin' for him All day I think of him dreamin' of him constantly I'm crazy mad for him and he's crazy mad for me  When he steps off that train amazingly full of fight Work all day to earn his pay so we can play all night My baby takes the morning train He works from nine to five and then He takes another home again To find me waitin' for him He's always on that morning train He works so hard To find me waiting for him
