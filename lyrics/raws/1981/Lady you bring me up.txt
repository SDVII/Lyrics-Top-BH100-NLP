Lady you bring me up when I'm down Maybe you're gonna change my life around You came to me when I was lonely And no one cared You made me see that I was only Just running scared I saw your face and something told me You were the one You smiled at me and now I see My life's begun Lady  you bring me up when I'm down Maybe you're gonna change my life around Lady you brought me in from out the rain  Maybe my life will never be the same Once I was filled with desperation A solitary man You gave me hope and inspiration Like only true love can Now I believe in what you're saying I'm ten feet tall This love don't need no explaining We've got it all Lady you bring me up when I'm down  Maybe  you're gonna change my life around Lady you bring me up when I'm down  Maybe  you're gonna change my life around Lady  you brought me in from out the rain Maybe my life will never be the same Lady you bring me up when I'm down  Maybe  you're gonna change my life around Lady you bring me up when I'm down Maybe you're gonna change my life around Lady
