Now everybody   have you heard If you're in the game then the stroke's the word Don't take no rhythm   don't take no style Got a thirst for killing   grab your vial You put your right hand out   give a firm hand shake Talk to me about the one big break Spread the ear pollution both far and wide Keep your contributions by your side and stroke me stroke me Could be a winner boy you move quite well You got your number down Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now You put your left foot out   keep it all in place Work your way right into my case First you try to bed me   you make my backbone slide But when you find you bled me   skip on by Keep on   stroke me stroke me   Give me the business all night long You're so together boy Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now Better listen now   said it ain't no joke Let your conscience fail ya   just do the stroke Don'tcha take no chances   keep your eye on top Do your fancy dances   you can't stop you just
