You can boogie like disco love that disco sound Turn up the volume and move it all around But don't don't don't don't don't forget oh no Don't don't don't don't don't forget The Stars On 45 keep on turning in your mind Like  We Can Work It Out  Remember  Twist and Shout  You still don't  Tell Me Why  and  No Reply  1 2 3 4    This happened once before when I came to your door No reply They said it wasn't you but I saw you peep through your window You know if you break my heart I'll go But I'll come back again 'Cause I told you once before goodbye But I came back again Asked a girl what she wanted to be And she said  Baby can't you see    I wanna be famous a star on the screen    But you can do something in between    Baby you can drive my car    Yes I'm gonna be a star    Baby you can drive my car    And baby I love you   Listen do you want to know a secret  Do you promise not to tell  Oh oh a oh oh Closer let me whisper in your ear Say the words you long to hear I'm in love with you  Try to see it my way Do I have to keep on talking 'til I can't go on  While you see it your way Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone We can work it out We can work it out I should've know better with a girl like you That I would love everything that you do And I do hey hey hey He's a real nowhere man sitting in his nowhere land You're gonna lose that girl You're gonna lose that girl You're gonna lose that girl I think I'm gonna be sad I think it's today yeah The girl that's driving me mad is going away She's got a ticket to ride she's got a ticket to ride She's got a ticket to ride and she don't care Say the word and you'll be free Say the word and be like me Say the word I'm thinking of Have you heard the word is love  It's so fine it's sunshine It's the word love Ahh look at all the lonely people Ahh look at all the lonely people When I'm walking beside her people tell me I'm lucky Yes I know I'm a lucky guy I remember the first time I was lonely without her Can't stop thinking about her now Every little thing she does she does for me yeah And you know the things she does she does for me oooh You tell me that you've got everything you want And your bird can sing But you don't get me you don't get me When your prized possessions start to wear you down Look in my direction I'll be around I'll be around Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner But he knew it wouldn't last Jojo left his home in Tucson Arizona For some California grass Get back get back get back to where you once belonged Get back get back get back to where you once belonged Got a good reason for takin' the easy way out Got a good reason for takin' the easy way out now She was a day tripper one way ticket yeah It took me so long to find out and I found out It's been a long time Now I'm coming back home I've been away now Oh how I've been alone Wait 'til I come back to your side We'll forget the tears we've cried But if your heart breaks Don't wait turn me away And if your heart's strong Hold on I won't delay The Stars On 45 keep on turning in your mind Like  We Can Work It Out  Remember  Twist and Shout  You still don't  Tell Me Why  and  No Reply
