When I think about your lovin' the Sunday evenings The fun we use to share Looking through the memories in my mind Since I've laughed and cried and thought it over Now I realize that it's never over only set aside Oh it's you sweet baby I will never be free from your embrace sweet baby Only hopin' it's not too late to try again It's you sweet baby Ever lost and captured by your smile sweet baby I will always be right there by your side right by your side Lyin' here alone I'm dreamin' my mind keeps wanderin' My thoughts are only you Wanderin' through the memories in my mind How could love so real have turned so empty I just keep wanderin' why Will I ever find the love we share together you and I Oh it's you sweet baby Though we've had such a long hard road to climb sweet baby Only hopin' it's not too late to try again It's you sweet baby Won't you try and believe in what I say  sweet baby I will always be right there by your side right by your side Oh it's you sweet baby I will never be free from your embrace sweet baby Only hopin' it's not too late to try again It's you sweet baby Ever lost and captured by your smile sweet baby I will always be right there by your side right by your side
