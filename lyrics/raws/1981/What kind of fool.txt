There was a time when we were down and out There was a place when we were starting over We let the bough break We let the heartache in Who's sorry now There was a world when we were standing still And for a moment we were separated And then you found him You let the stranger in Who's sorry now Who's sorry now What what kind of fool Tears it apart Leaving me pain and sorrow Losing you now  Where will I be tomorrow Was there a moment when I cut you down Played around What have I done I only apologize For being as they say the last to know It has to show When someone is in your eyes What what kind of fool  Tears it apart Leaving me pain and sorrow How can I win Where will I be tomorrow Why why Why why Don't leave me baby Where will I go where will you be What have I done Oh where will I be So tell me why why why What kind of fool
