 I m coming home I m coming home Tell the world I m coming home Let the rain wash away All the pain of yesterday I know my kingdom awaits And they ve forgiven my mistakes I m coming home I m coming home Tell the world I m coming I m back where I belong I never felt so strong man I feel like there s nothing I can t try And if you feel me put your hands high If you ever lost a light before this one s for you And you the dreams are for you I hear the Tears of a Clown uh I hate that song I always feel like they re talking to me when it comes on Another day another dawn Another Keisha nice to meet ya get the math I m gone What am I supposed to do when the club lights come on It s easy to be Puff but it s harder to be Sean What if my twins ask why I ain t marry their mom Damn how do I respond What if my son stares with a face like my own And says he wants to be like me when he s grown Shit But I ain t finished growing Another night the inevitable prolongs Another day another dawn Just tell Keisha and Teresa I ll be better in the morn Another lie that I carry on I need to get back to the place where I belong I m coming home I m coming home Tell the world that I m coming home Let the rain wash away All the pain of yesterday I know my kingdom awaits And they ve forgiven my mistakes I m coming home I m coming home Tell the world I m coming home A House Is Not a Home I hate this song Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it But you felt it and still feel it And money can t make up for it or conceal it But you deal with it and you keep ballin Pour out some liquor playboy and we keep ballin Baby we been living in sin Cause we been really in love but we been living as friends So you ve been a guest in your own home It s time to make your house your home Pick up your phone come on I m coming home I m coming home Tell the world that I m coming home Let the rain wash away All the pain of yesterday I know my kingdom awaits And they ve forgiven my mistakes I m coming home I m coming home Tell the world I m coming Ain t No Stopping Us Now I love that song Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong I thought I told y all that we won t stop Til we back cruisin through Harlem these old blocks It s what made me saved me drove me crazy Drove me away then embraced me Forgave me for all of my shortcomings Welcome to my homecoming Yeah it s been a long time coming Lot of fights lot of scars lot of bottles Lot of cars lot of ups lot of downs Made it back lost my dog But here I stand a better man Thank you Lord Thank you all I m coming home I m coming home Tell the world that I m coming home Let the rain wash away All the pain of yesterday I know my kingdom awaits And they ve forgiven my mistakes I m coming home I m coming home Tell the world I m coming
