 There s a fire starting in my heart Reaching a fever pitch and it s bringing me out the dark Finally I can see you crystal clear Go ahead and sell me out and then I ll lay your ship bare See how I ll leave with every piece of you Don t underestimate the things that I will do There s a fire starting in my heart Reaching a fever pitch and it s bringing me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us They keep me thinkin that we almost had it all The scars of your love they leave me breathless I can t help feeling We could have had it all Rolling in the deep You had my heart inside of your hand And you played it to the beat Baby I have no story to be told But I ve heard one on you Now I m gonna make your head burn Think of me in the depths of your despair Make a home down there As mine sure won t be shared The scars of your love remind me of us They keep me thinkin that we almost had it all The scars of your love they leave me breathless I can t help feeling We could have had it all Rolling in the deep You had my heart inside of your hand And you played it to the beat Could have had it all Rolling in the deep You had my heart inside of your hand But you played it with a beating Throw your soul through every open door Count your blessings to find what you look for Turn my sorrow into treasured gold You ll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow We could have had it all We could have had it all It all it all it all We could have had it all Rolling in the deep You had my heart inside of your hand And you played it to the beat We could have had it all Rolling in the deep You had my heart inside of your hand But you played it you played it you played it You played it to the beat
