 There s a stranger in my bed There s a pounding in my head Glitter all over the room Pink flamingos in the pool I smell like a minibar DJ s passed out in the yard Barbies on the barbeque This a hickie or a bruise Pictures of last night ended up online I m screwed oh well It s a blacked out blur but I m pretty sure it ruled Damn Last Friday night Yeah we danced on tabletops And we took too many shots Think we kissed but I forgot Last Friday night Yeah we maxed our credit cards And got kicked out of the bar so we hit the boulevard Last Friday night We went streaking in the park Skinny dipping in the dark then had a m nage trois Last Friday night Yeah I think we broke the law Always say we re going to stop op oh woah But this Friday night do it all again But this Friday night do it all again Trying to connect the dots Don t know what to tell my boss Think the city towed my car Chandelier is on the floor Ripped my favorite party dress Warrant s out for my arrest Think I need a ginger ale That was such an epic fail Pictures of last night ended up online I m screwed oh well It s a blacked out blur but I m pretty sure it ruled Damn Last Friday night Yeah we danced on tabletops And we took too many shots Think we kissed but I forgot Last Friday night Yeah we maxed our credit cards And got kicked out of the bar so we hit the boulevard Last Friday night We went streaking in the park Skinny dipping in the dark then had a m nage trois Last Friday night Yeah I think we broke the law Always say we re going to stop op oh woah But this Friday night do it all again This Friday night do it all again This Friday night T G I F T G I F T G I F T G I F T G I F T G I F Last Friday night Yeah we danced on tabletops And we took too many shots Think we kissed but I forgot Last Friday night Yeah we maxed our credit cards And got kicked out of the bar so we hit the boulevard Last Friday night We went streaking in the park Skinny dipping in the dark then had a m nage trois Last Friday night Yeah I think we broke the law Always say we re going to stop op oh woah But this Friday night do it all again
