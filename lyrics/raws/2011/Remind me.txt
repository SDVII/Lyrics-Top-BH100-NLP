We didn t care if people stared We d make out in a crowd somewhere Somebody d tell us to get a room It s hard to believe that was me and you Now we keep saying that we re okay But I don t want to settle for good not great I miss the way that it felt back then I wanna feel that way again Been so long bet you forget The way I used to kiss your neck Remind me remind me So on fire so in love Way back when we couldn t get enough Remind me remind me Remember the airport dropping me off We were kissing goodbye and we couldn t stop And I felt bad cause you missed your flight But that meant we had one more night Do you remember how it used to be We d turn out the lights and we didn t just sleep Remind me baby remind me Oh so on fire so in love That look in your eyes that I miss so much Remind me baby remind me I wanna feel that way Yeah I wanna hold you close Oh if you still love me Don t just assume I know Oh baby remind me Remind me Do you remember the way it felt You mean back when we couldn t control ourselves Remind me yeah remind me All those things that you used to do That made me fall in love with you Remind me oh baby remind me Yeah you d wake up in my old t shirt All those mornings I was late for work Remind me oh baby remind me yeah Oh baby remind me Baby remind me yeah oh Baby remind me
