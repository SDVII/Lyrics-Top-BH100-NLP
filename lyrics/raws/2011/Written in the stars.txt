 Oh written in the stars A million miles away a message to the main oh Seasons come and go but I will never change And I m on my way Yeah you re listening now They say they ain t heard nothing like this in a while That s why they play my song on so many different dials Cause I got more fuckin hits than a disciplined child So when they see me everybody brrrap brrraps Man I m like a young gun fully black Barack I cried tear drops over the Massive Attack I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat Look at my jacket and hat so damn berserk So down to earth I m bringing gravity back Adopted by the major I want my family back People work hard just to get all their salary taxed Look I m just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman Damn I used to be the kid that no one cared about That s why you have to keep screaming til they hear you out Oh written in the stars A million miles away a message to the main oh Seasons come and go but I will never change And I m on my way Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Yeah I needed a change when we ate we never tipped Because we needed the change I needed a break For a sec I even gave up believing and praying I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray They say that money is the root to the evilist ways But have you ever been so hungry it keeps you awake Mate now my hunger would leave them amazed great It feels like a long time coming fam Since the day I thought of that cunning plan One day I had a dream I tried to chase it But I wasn t going nowhere running man I knew that maybe someday I would understand Tryna change a tenner to a hundred grand Everyone s a kid that no one cares about You just gotta keep screaming until they hear you out Oh written in the stars A million miles away a message to the main oh Seasons come and go but I will never change And I m on my way Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh seasons come and go but I will never change And I m on my way
