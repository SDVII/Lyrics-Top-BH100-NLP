 Lately I ve been stuck imagining What I wanna do and what I really think Time to blow out Be a little inappropriate Cause I know that everybody s thinking it When the light s out Shame on me To need release Uncontrollably I wanna go all the way taking out my freak tonight I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind Whoa I wanna go all the way taking out my freak tonight I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind Whoa Lately people got me all tied up There s a countdown waiting for me to erupt Time to blow out I ve been told just what to do with it To keep both my hands above the blanket When the light s out Shame on me To need release Uncontrollably I wanna go all the way taking out my freak tonight I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind Whoa I wanna go all the way taking out my freak tonight I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind Whoa Shame on me To need release Uncontrollably I wanna go All the way taking out my freak tonight I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind I wanna go all the way taking out my freak tonight I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind Whoa
