 No matter what you say about love I keep coming back for more Keep my hand in the fire Sooner or later I get what I m asking for No matter what you say about life I learn every time I bleed The truth is a stranger Soul is in danger I gotta let my spirit be free to Admit that I m wrong And then change my mind Sorry but I have to move on And leave you behind I can t waste time so give it a moment I realize nothing s broken No need to worry bout everything I ve done Live every second like it was my last one Don t look back at a new direction I loved you once Needed protection You re still a part of everything I do You re on my heart just like a tattoo Just like a tattoo I ll always have you I ll always have you I ll always have you I m sick of playing all of these games It s not about taking sides When I looked in the mirror It didn t deliver It hurt enough to think that I could stop Admit that I m wrong And then change my mind Sorry but I got to be strong And leave you behind I can t waste time so give it a moment I realize nothing s broken No need to worry bout everything I ve done Live every second like it was my last one Don t look back at a new direction I loved you once Needed protection You re still a part of everything I do You re on my heart just like a tattoo Just like a tattoo I ll always have you I ll always have you I ll always have you If I live every moment Won t change any moment There s still a part of me in you I will never regret you Still the memory of you Marks everything I do oh I can t waste time so give it a moment I realize nothing s broken No need to worry bout everything I ve done Live every second like it was my last one Don t look back at a new direction I loved you once Needed protection You re still a part of everything I do You re on my heart just like a tattoo I can t waste time so give it a moment I realize nothing s broken No need to worry about everything I ve done Live every second like it was my last one Don t look back at a new direction I loved you once Needed protection You re still a part of everything I do You re on my heart just like a tattoo Just like a tattoo I ll Always have you
