 I m hot you re cold You go around like you know Who I am but you don t You ve got me on my toes I m slipping into the lava And I m trying to keep from going under Baby who turned the temperature hotter Cause I m burnin up burnin up for you baby Come on girl I fell so fast Can t hold myself back High heels red dress All by yourself gotta catch my breath I m slipping into the lava And I m trying to keep from going under Baby who turned the temperature hotter Cause I m burnin up burnin up for you baby Walk in the room all I can see is you oh Staring me down I know you feel it too I m slipping into the lava And I m trying to keep from going under Baby who turned the temperature hotter Cause I m burnin up burnin up for you baby Slipping into the lava And I m trying to keep from going under Baby who turned the temperature hotter Cause I m burnin up burnin up for you baby Yo we re burning up in this place tonight Your Brothers sing it loud Get up and dance Big Rob s for real Stop drop and roll more and more I got JB with me Come on boys let s bring the chorus around I m slipping into the lava And I m trying to keep from going under Baby who turned the temperature hotter Cause I m burnin up burnin up for you baby Burnin up burnin up for you baby
