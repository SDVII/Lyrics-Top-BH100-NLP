 Well you done done me in you bet I felt it I tried to be chill but you re so hot that I melted I fell right through the cracks And now I m trying to get back Before the cool done run out I ll be giving it my bestest And nothing s going to stop me but divine intervention I reckon it s again my turn to win some or learn some But I won t hesitate no more no more It cannot wait I m yours Well open up your mind and see like me Open up your plans and damn you re free Look into your heart and you ll find love love love love Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing We re just one big family And it s our God forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved So I won t hesitate no more no more It cannot wait I m sure There s no need to complicate Our time is short This is our fate I m yours But do do do do you but do you do do do you but do you want to come on scooch on over closer dear And I will nibble your ear I ve been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror And bendin over backwards just to try to see it clearer But my breath fogged up the glass And so I drew a new face and I laughed I guess what I m saying is there ain t no better reason To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons It s what we aim to do Our name is our virtue But I won t hesitate no more no more It cannot wait I m yours Well open up your mind and see like me Open up your plans and damn you re free Look into your heart and you ll find that the sky is yours So please don t please don t please don t There s no need to complicate Cause our time is short This oh this oh this is our fate I m yours
