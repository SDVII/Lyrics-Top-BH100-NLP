 Sent from heaven Sent from heaven Now you can wait your whole life wondering When it s gonna come or where it s been You may have got your heart broken A few times in the past Never last strong as it used to Don t feel as good as it used to And all the things you used to say Things you used to do went right out the door Oh no more will you be the one That s what you tell everyone around you But you know they ve heard it all before What more can you say When love won t let you walk away And you can t help who you love And you find yourself giving it away When you think you re in love I wanna be the one who you believe In your heart is sent from There s a piece of me who leaves when you gone Because you re sent from Now you can wait your whole life tryna change What the fear from what it s been You may have put your whole life into a man Loving what you thought that could ve been Notice when you change When you don t feel as good as you used to And everything you used to say Everything you used to do clear right out the door Everybody say I wanna be the one you love I wanna be Everybody say I wanna be the one you trust I wanna be Everybody say I wanna be the one you need I wanna be Everybody say I wanna be the one who sent from heaven
