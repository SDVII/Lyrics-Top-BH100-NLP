Hum ohh baby aww baby Yeah We goin take you back a little further Thinkin back on you and me Remembering how it use to be Those times are precious I cherish every moment we spent Yeah Thinkin back on all the arguments Thinkin back way back when We kissed and made up and all was fair in love So now we gotta go back baby Going back to when When we were one When love was fun Dig it Remembering the first time you showed me your love The feeling was so strong heaven sent from above But you had no right to play with my heart You showed no shame Time after time and place after place Night after night and day after day I m still missing your love and the feelings we share Sometimes I cry at night coz I feel so all alone I need your love right here with me to keep me safe and warm I m going back to when When we were one we were one girl Ohh baby girl When we were one Baby save me I m thinkin thinkin back Play Mr Music Man Play Play Mr Music Man Ua ohh ohh I m Thinkin back
