Life s like a road that you travel on When there s one day here and the next day gone Sometimes you bend sometimes you stand Sometimes you turn your back to the wind There s a world outside every darkened door Where blues won t haunt you anymore Where the brave are free and lovers soar Come ride with me to the distant shore We won t hesitate break down the garden gate There s not much left today Life is a highway I want to ride it all night long If you re going my way I want to drive it all night long Through all the cities and all these towns It s in my blood and it s all around I love you now like I loved you then This is the road and these are the hands From Mozambique to those Memphis nights The Khyber Pass to Vancouver s lights Knock me down get back up again You re in my blood I m not a lonely man There s no load I can t hold Road so rough this I know I ll bee there when the light comes in Tell em we re survivors Life is a highway I want to ride it all night long If you re going my way I want to drive it all night long hmm Life is a highway I want to ride it all night long If you re going my way I want to drive it all night long There was a distance between you and I A misunderstanding once but now We look it in the eye Oh Ooh There s no load I can t hold Road so rough this I know I ll be there when the light comes in Tell em we re survivors Life is a highway I want to ride it all night long yeah yeah yeah If you re going my way I want to drive it all night long yeah yeah Life is a highway I want to ride it all night long If you re going my way I want to drive it all night long Life is a highway I want to ride it all night long yeah If you re going my way I want to drive it all night long ooh
