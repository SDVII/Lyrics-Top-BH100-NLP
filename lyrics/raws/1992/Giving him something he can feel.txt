 Shoo Shoo Shoo Shoo Many say that I m too young To let you know just where I m coming from yeah But you will see it s just a matter of time My love will surely make you mine Well I m livin in a world of ghetto life Everyone seems so uptight But nothin s wrong and it s alright with my man I like the way we carry on His love will send me on and on with my man People out there can understand I m giving him something he can feel To let him know this love is real Giving him something he can feel To let him know this love is real This love is real So much joy for us it seems So much hope for material things Are they only in my dreams And that s exactly why I m singing this song to you To let you know that real dreams do come true You tell me what does it mean Livin in a world of ghetto life Everyone is so uptight hey Nothin s wrong it s alright my man I like the way we carry on His lovin will send me on and on with my man People out there can understand that I m giving him something he can feel To let him know this love is real Giving him something he can feel To let him know this love is real This love is real Giving him something he can feel Giving him something he can feel Giving him something he can feel Giving him something he can feel
