 There you are holding her hand I am lost dying to understand Didn t I cherish you right Don t you know you were my life Even though I try I can t let go Something in your eyes captured my soul And every night I see you in my dreams You re all I know I can t let go Just cast aside you don t even know I m alive You just walk on by don t care to see me cry And here I am still holding on I can t accept my world is gone no no Even though I try I can t let go Cause something in your eyes captured my soul And every night I see you in my dreams You re all I know I can t let go Do you even realize the sorrow I have inside Every day of my life Do you know the way it feels when all you have just dies I try and try to deny that I need you But still you remain on my mind Even though I try I can t let go Something in your eyes captured my soul Cause every night I see you in my dreams You re all I know I can t let you go Even though I try I can t let go Something in your eyes captured my soul Every night I see you in my dreams You re all I know I can t let go
