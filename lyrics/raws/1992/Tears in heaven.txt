 Would you know my name If I saw you in heaven Would it be the same If I saw you in heaven I must be strong and carry on Cause I know I don t belong here in heaven Would you hold my hand If I saw you in heaven Would you help me stand If I saw you in heaven I ll find my way through night and day Cause I know I just can t stay here in heaven Time can bring you down time can bend your knees Time can break your heart have you begging please begging please Beyond the door there s peace I m sure And I know there ll be no more tears in heaven Would you know my name If I saw you in heaven Would you feel the same If I saw you in heaven I must be strong and carry on Because I know I don t belong here in heaven
