Mornings alone When you come home I breathe a little faster Every time we re together It d never be the same If you re not here How can you stay away Away so long Why can t we stay together Give me a reason give me a reason Cause I I don t want to say it I don t want to find another way Make it through the day without you I I can t resist Trying to find exactly what I miss It s just another day without you It s just another day oh Making the time to make you stay forever What do I have to tell you I m just trying to hold on to something Oh give us a chance to make it To make it Oh no no Don t wanna hold on to never I m not that strong I m not that strong I I don t want to say it I don t want to find another way Make it through the day without you I I can t resist Trying to find exactly what I miss It s just another day without you No Why can t you stay forever Just give me a reason give me a reason Cause I I don t want to say it I don t want to find another way Make it through the day without you I I can t resist Trying to find exactly what I miss It s just another day without you I I don t want to say it I don t want to find another way Make it through the day without you I I can t resist Trying to find exactly what I miss It s just another day without you
