 Sometimes I feel like I don t have a partner Sometimes I feel like my only friend Is the city I live in the city of angels Lonely as I am together we cry I drive on her streets cause she s my companion I walk through her hills cause she knows who I am She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy Well I never worry now that is a lie I don t ever wanna feel like I did that day But take me to the place I love take me all the way I don t ever wanna feel like I did that day But take me to the place I love take me all the way Yeah yeah yeah It s hard to believe that there s nobody out there It s hard to believe that I m all alone At least I have her love the city she loves me Lonely as I am together we cry I don t ever wanna feel like I did that day But take me to the place I love take me all the way I don t ever wanna feel like I did that day But take me to the place I love take me all the way Yeah yeah yeah Oh no no no yeah yeah Love me I say yeah yeah One time Is where I drew some blood I could not get enough Forgot about my love I gave my life away Yeah yeah yeah Oh no no no yeah yeah Here I stay yeah yeah Here I stay
