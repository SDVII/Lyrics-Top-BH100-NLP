Like a warrior that fights and wins the battle I know the taste of victory Though I went through some nights consumed by the shadows I was crippled emotionally   Somehow I made it through the heartache yes I did Oh I escaped  I found my way out of the darkness I kept my faith  kept my faith When the river was deep I didn't falter When the mountain was high I still believed When the valley was low it didn't stop me no no I knew you were waiting I knew you were waiting for me Uh huh With an endless desire I kept on searching Sure in time our eyes would meet And like a bridge that's on fire the hurt is over One touch and you set me free   No I don't regret a single moment no I don't  Looking back When I think of all those disappointments I just laugh  I just laugh When the river was deep I didn't falter When the mountain was high I still believed When the valley was low it didn't stop me oh I knew you were waiting hey I knew you were waiting for me So we were drawn together through destiny ooh boy ooh  I know this love we share was meant to be oh  Ooh yeah  I knew you were waiting  I didn't falter no  When the valley was low  Nothing can stop me no  No I  When the mountain was high  Oh when the valley was low  No it didn't stop me no  Oh oh yeah  Oh I still believed  Do you know it couldn't stop me now  No Someday  somehow  For me  When the valley was low  I still believe   Yeah it couldn't stop me
