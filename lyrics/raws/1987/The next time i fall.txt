Love like a road that never ends How it leads me back again To heartache I'll never understand Darling I put my heart up on a shelf Til the moment was right and I told myself The next time I fall in love I'll know better what to do The next time I fall in love Oooh The next time I fall in love The next time I fall in love It will be with you Now as I look into you eyes Well I wonder if it's wise To hold you like I've wanted to before Tonight I was thinking that you might Be the one who breathes life in this heart of mine Next time I fall in love I know better what to do Next time I fall in love Oooh Next time I fall in love Next time I fall in love It will be with you Next time I'm gonna follow through And if it drives me crazy I will know better why The next time I try Next time I fall in love I know better what to do Next time I fall in love Oooh Next time I fall in love Next time I fall in love The next time I fall in love It will be with you Next time I fall in love Next time I fall in love Next time I fall in love Next time I fall in love
