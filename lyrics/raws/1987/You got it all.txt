I I was a game he would play He brought the clouds to my day Then like a ray of light You came my way one night Just one look And I knew You would make everything clear Make all the clouds disappear Put all your fears to rest Who do I love the best  Don't you know Don't you know You got it all over him You got me over him Honey it's true There's just you You must have been heaven sent Hearing me call you went Out on a limb And you're all that he's not Just look what I got 'Cause you got it all Over him No Don't let him worry you so Once I met you I let go Oh you can surely see You're so much more to me Just one look And I knew You would make everything clear Make all the clouds disappear You're better than all the rest Who do I love the best Don't you know Don't you know
