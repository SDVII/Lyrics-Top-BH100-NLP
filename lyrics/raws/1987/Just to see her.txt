Just to see her Just to touch her Just to hold her in my arms again One more time If I could feel her warm embrace See her smiling face Can't find anyone to take her place I've got to see her again I would do anything I would go anywhere There's nothing I wouldn't do Just to see her again I can't hide it no I can't fight it oh It's so hard to live without the love She gave to me Doesn't she know it  I tried hard not to show it Can't I make her realize that she Really needs me again  I would do anything I would go anywhere There's nothing I wouldn't do Just to see her again She brightened up my everyday Made me feel so good in every way If I could have her back to stay I've got to see her again I want to see her Hold her hold her hold her See her Touch her I would do anything I would go anywhere There's nothing I wouldn't do Just to see her again She brightens up my everyday Makes me feel so good in every way If I could have her back to stay I've got to see her again It would it would it would Make me feel so good If I if I could only see her again There's nothin' I wouldn't do Oh don't you know it's true  If I could only see her again
