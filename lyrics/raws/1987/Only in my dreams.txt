Everytime I'm telling secrets I remember how it used to be And I realized how much I miss you And I realize how it feels to be free Now I see I'm up to no good And I wanna start again Can't remember when I felt good No I can't remember when No only in my dreams As real as it may seem It was only in my dreams Couldn't see how much I missed you Couldn't see how much it meant  Now I see my world come tumbling down Now I see the road is bent If I only once could hold you And remember how it used to be  If only I could scold you And forget how it feels to be free No only in my dreams As real as it may seem It was only in my dreams No No no no only in my dreams As real as it may seem It was only in my dreams No only in my dreams As real as it may seem It was only in my dreams No No no no only in my dreams As real as it may seem It was only in my dreams No no no only in my dreams As real as it may seem It was only in my dreams
