Something in the moonlight catches my eye The shadow of a lover goes dancing by Looking for a little bit of love to grow so Give me love give me heart and soul You never let me cross to the other side now I'm tied to the hope that you will somehow Hard on the heels of something more But I lost your love heart and soul The tear in my heart as you walk on by  I feel so low and your head is high Everything you do convinces me more please  Give me love give me heart and soul Looking to the day when I saw your face  I wasn't in the running I wasn't in the race You move in a way that I've known before Now I want your love heart and soul Leaving you ain't easy now  Loving you's the harder part  You never want me for myself  Now I've needed you right from the very start  Oh won't you even try to  Give a little bit of heart and soul  Give a little bit of love to grow Give a little bit of heart and soul  And don't you make me beg for more  Give a sign I need to know A little bit of heart and soul Walking on the water walking on the air  That was the heart of the love we shared Do you keep secret left untold  Can't give love heart or soul I used to have a lover with a Midas touch  I turned to gold but he turned to dust Left me for another I turned to stone Now give me love heart and soul Living in a fantasy  There's never any room to breathe  Hoping every waking hour  You'll turn around and say that we can start  Oh won't you even try to  Give a little bit of heart and soul  Give a little bit of love to grow Give a little bit of heart and soul  And don't you make me beg for more  Give a sign I need to know A little bit of heart and soul Somehow I lost my way Looking to see something in your eyes But love will never compromise Now this is the politics of life yeah  Give a little bit of heart and soul  Give a little bit of love to grow Give a little bit of heart and soul  And don't you make me beg for more  Give a sign I need to know A little bit little bit Give a little bit of heart and soul  Give a little bit of love to grow Give a little bit of heart and soul  And don't you make me beg for more  Give a sign I need to know A little bit little bit Give a little bit of heart and soul  Give a little bit of love to grow Give a little bit of heart and soul  And don't you make me beg for more  Give a sign I need to know whoooah  Give a little bit of heart and soul Give a little bit of heart and soul
