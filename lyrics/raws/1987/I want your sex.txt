It s late Time for bed So I sit and I wait For that gin and tonic To go to your head I know It s a devious plan But it s the only way that I know To get those big bad car keys Out of your hand You know That I remain a gentleman But even so There s only so much A gentleman can stand Sleep with me Oh Sleep with me tonight My cards are on your table My dreams are in your bed Oh if I was able I d be there instead Oh oh Oh sleep with me tonight
