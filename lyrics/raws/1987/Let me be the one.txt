Sometimes people play with love Falling in love is just a game Don't think I don't know love You'll never be alone again Show you how I feel That I need so much Give you what is real That I long to touch Only you can make me feel this way I give you all Come on Let's get away This love I feel Will never ever fade I give you more and more So To hold on to the dream You can trust me at any time Give you all my love To feel your tender touch The first time That I saw you there Thought I knew you from before Promise me you will never leave Cause I will never let you go Hold you close to me Because our love is strong Fill the need in me Together we belong Only you can make me feel brand new I can feel it in my heart Your love is true Together We are one instead of two I want you more and more So To hold on to the dream You can trust me at any time I want to give you all my love Let me be the one Only you can make me feel this way I give you all Come on Let's get away This love I feel Will never ever fade I give you more and more So To hold on to the dream You can trust me at any time To give you all my love And feel your tender touch To hold on to the dream You can trust me at any time
