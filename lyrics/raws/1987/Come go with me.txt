Feels the same every day Come home from work late again Work so hard and never play I can't wait to take you far away Don't you know Got to go Pressure builds from everyone every day Get away Come my way When the day begins to end then you're mine Come go with me oh Make you feel alive This night will last Everlasting through the time Come go with me oh Have no fears Bring back the memories I can take away the misery Take my hand we'll fly away To our world that we can find today Can you feel I'm for real Can I hold you by the fire in the night Is it right Hold me tight When you look into my eyes in the light Come go with me Don't worry 'bout tomorrow Just come go with me Don't let it end in sorrow Love is our destiny I'll take you by the hand And we'll find another land Oh leave the world behind The world of nine to five Come go with me Yeah Into the night Into the night Into the night Hey hey hey hey Get away with me tonight Stay with me tonight I can can can Can can give you love I can can can Can can give you love Get away with me tonight Stay with me tonight I can can can Can can give you love I can can can can Can can give you love
