When lights go down I see no reason For you to cry we've been through this before In every time in every season God knows I've tried So please don't ask for more Can't you see it in my eyes  Though this might be our last goodbye Carrie Carrie Things they change my friend Woh ohh Carrie Carrie Maybe we'll meet again Somewhere again I read your mind with no intentions Of being unkind I wish I could explain It all takes time A whole lot of patience If it's a crime how can I feel no pain  Can't you see it in my eyes  Though this might be our last goodbye Carrie Carrie Things they change my friend Woh ohh Carrie Carrie Maybe we'll meet again Somewhere again Ohh Can't you see it in my eyes  Though this might be our last goodbye Ohh Carrie Carrie Ohh things they change Carrie Carrie Carrie Carrie Carrie Maybe we'll meet again Oh somewhere again When lights go down
