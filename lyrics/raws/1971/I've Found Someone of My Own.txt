Chorus  I ve been running  way from my sorrys Been running  way from you and my problems Finally found a place to console me Found a place where you can t control me And I ve been thinking  bout if you miss me again See me walking  round miss my texts hoping That I m in a bad state of mind now But I m living without you somehow Verse 1  Boyz 2 men we at the end of our road This the type of shit you gotta spit from the soul I m getting fucking tired  cause this shit s getting old There s only so much love that you can give to a hoe I think that she cheated cause my wrist didn t glow I tried to deal with it now my liver s toast I think we both know you gon  end up alone But now I m with your best friend and now I m getting the dome Yeah And you don t even know I been going through these moments tryna gain control Is it true  Do you love me or you don t swear I live it when you don t Got me fighting all these battles like I m leaning on the ropes It ain t easy when you fighting through it If I m honest hate when you be lying to me Bringing dramas why I want it all If god has it so it ain t about the commas Baby tell me all your problems we can work it out Chorus  I ve been running  way from my sorrys Been running  way from you and my problems Finally found a place to console me Found a place where you can t control me And I ve been thinking  bout if you miss me again See me walking  round miss my texts hoping That I m in a bad state of mind now But I m living without you somehow Verse 2  Want me to give you all attention But that shit s no longer my intention Made me hate my own reflection These dark througts are growing like infection You're obsessed with thinking about the future How we might grow old together  How our lives are gonna be planned  And that we are made for eachother  But you ruined my mind again Making my stomach feel queezy Turn to the hard stuff Slamming drinks Smoking loud and popping Es like Eazy Why the fuck would you care how I feel now Got my mind all fucked like you own me  Can't face the fact that you're not in my life and i got my fix and the shackles are free Honeymoon period  Man it's just a phase  Feel like i'm 14 again dying my hair black and listening to 'Basket Case' I thought it was real I thought you were true But you round hanging with some other girls while i'm working hard in the Stu I'm sorry I couldn't do better I gave you the best I could give But you found someone better Now i'm alone with my conifdence hid Maybe I'll be alone forever Maybe I'll live with my parents Oh wait they don't like me either Ran away from me right after eachother Chorus  I ve been running  way from my sorrys Been running  way from you and my problems Finally found a place to console me Found a place where you can t control me And I ve been thinking  bout if you miss me again See me walking  round miss my texts hoping That I m in a bad state of mind now But I m living without you somehow Bridge  Ohhhh Ohhh Ohhh Ohh Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Ohh Ohh Oh Oh Oh Ha Oh Oh Seems like you're happy now Seems like your life do allow for you to move on And prove I was wrong And I'm still thinking about you writing fucking songs And I'm scared to move on Outro  I ve been running  way from my sorrys Been running  way from you and my problems Finally found a place to console me Found a place where you can t control me And I ve been thinking  bout if you miss me again See me walking  round miss my texts hoping That I m in a bad state of mind now But I m living without you somehow
