Here comes that rainy day feeling again And soon my tears will be falling like rain It always seems to be a Monday Leftover memories of Sunday Always spent with you Before the clouds appeared And took away my sunshine Here comes that rainy day feeling again And I'll be dreaming of you baby in vain Your face is always on my mind girl I'm hoping you're soon gonna find girl Your way back to me 'Cause if you'll say you'll stay The rainy days will go away    Misty morning eyes I'm trying to disguise the way I feel But I just can't hide it People seem to know The loneliness will show I'm thinking of my pride But breaking up inside girl Whoa oa oa here comes that rainy day feeling again And soon my tears They will be falling like rain It always seems to be a Monday Left over memories of Sunday Always spent with you Before the clouds appeared and took away my sunshine Here comes that rainy day feeling again Here comes that rainy day feeling again Here comes that rainy day feeling again
