It is the special one It never sees the sun It only comes up When the moon is on the run And all the stars are gleaming It's growing in the street Right up through the concrete But soft sweet and dreamy With eyes as black as coal That look down in his soul It start a fire there and then he looses control I'm gonna beg his par ar ar ardon yeah He's going to pick that rose And watch her as she grows In his garden With eyes as black as coal That look down in his soul And start a fire there and then he loses control And i wanna beg his par ar ar don He's going to pick that rose And watch her as she grows In his garden
