Do it for love don't hold you up As for kisses once hefty stuff Don't be afraid let me know There's other places baby that I can go If you don't like it don't knock it Somebody eles might go and rock it Oh if you don't need it don't waste it Somebody eles might wanna taste it Aw baby Aw baby if the thrill don't turn you on And the will is much too strong Don't waste my time with your foolish ways I got other plans to do with my days If you don't like it don't knock it Somebody eles might go and rock it Hey If you don't need it don't waste it Somebody eles might wanna taste it Awww hey ooo Lord Lord Ooww  Wholl love wholl dance with me Who in all will go all away round town I'm the one that turn you on I'm the same one that leave you alone Don't knock my love don't knock my love Don't knock my love baby don't knock my love Aawww  Good God almighty it's alright Aawww  Yeah don't knock my love
