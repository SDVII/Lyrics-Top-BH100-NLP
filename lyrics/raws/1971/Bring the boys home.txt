Fathers are pleading lovers are all alone Mothers are prayin' send our sons back home  You marched them away yes you did now on ships and planes To a senseless war facing death in vain Bring the boys home  Bring the boys home  Bring the boys home  Bring the boys home   Turn the ships around  Lay your weapons down Can't you see 'em marchin' 'cross the sky  All the soldiers that have died Tryin' to get home Can't you see them tryin' to get home  Tryin' to get home They're tryin' to get home Cease all fire  on the battlefield Enough men have already been wounded and killed Bring the boys home  Bring the boys home  Bring the boys home  Bring the boys home   Turn the ships around  Lay your weapons down Tryin' to get home Can't you see them tryin' to get home Tryin' to get home Tryin' to get home Bring the boys home  Bring the boys home  Bring the boys home  Bring the boys home  What they doin' over there now  When we need 'em over here now   What they doin' over there now  When we need 'em over here now   Bring 'em all bring 'em all home  Bring 'em all bring 'em home now
