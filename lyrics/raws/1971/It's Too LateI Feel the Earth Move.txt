I feel the earth move under my feet I feel the sky tumbling down I feel my heart start to trembling Whenever you re around Ooh baby when I see your face Mellow as the month of May Oh darling I can t stand it When you look at me that way I feel the earth move under my feet I feel the sky tumbling down I feel my heart start to trembling Whenever you re around Ooo darling when you re near me And you tenderly call my name I know that my emotions Are something I just can t tame I ve just got to have you baby uh huh huh uh huh huh yeah I feel the earth move under my feet I feel the sky tumbling down a tumbling down I feel the earth move under my feet I feel the sky tumbling down a tumbling down I just lose control Down to my very soul I get hot and cold all over all over all over all over I feel the earth move under my feet I feel the sky tumbling down a tumbling down I feel the earth move under my feet I feel the sky tumbling down a tumbling down A tumbling down a tumbling down a tumbling down a tumbling down tumbling down
