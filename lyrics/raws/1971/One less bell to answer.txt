One less bell to answer One less egg to fry One less man to pick up after I should be happy But all I do is cry Oh I should be happy I only know that since he left My life's so empty Though I try to forget It just can't be done Each time the doorbell rings I still run I don't know how in the world To stop thinking of him 'Cause I still love him so I end each day the way I start out Crying my heart out Oh one less man to pick up after No more laughter No more love Since he went oh he went away  Why did he leave me Now I've got one less egg to fry One less egg to fry And all I do is cry Because my man told me goodbye Somebody tell me please Where did he go why did he go Tell me how could he leave me
