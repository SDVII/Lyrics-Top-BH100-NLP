It don't come easy You know it don't come easy Got to pay your dues if you want to sing the blues And you know it don't come easy You don't have to shout or leap about You can even play them easy Forget about the past and all your sorrows The future won't last It will soon be over tomorrow I don't ask for much I only want your trust And you know it don't come easy And this love of mine keeps growing all the time And you know it just ain't easy Open up your heart let's come together Use a little love And we will make it work out better Peace remember peace is how we make it Here within your reach If you're big enough to take it
