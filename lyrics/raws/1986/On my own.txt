So many times Said it was forever Said our love would always be true Something in my heart always knew I'd be lying here beside you On my own On my own On my own So many promises never should be spoken Now I know what loving you cost Now we're up to talking divorce And we weren't even married On my own Once again now One more time By myself No one said it was easy No But it once was so easy Well I believed in love  Now here I stand I wonder why Ooh I'm on my own Why did it end this way This wasn't how it was supposed to be On my own I wish that we could do it all again So many times I know I could have told you Losing you It cut like a knife Hey You walked out and there went my life I don't want to live without you On my own This wasn't how it was supposed to end On my own I wish that we could do it all again On my own I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone By myself On my own I've got to find out where I belong again I've got to learn to be strong again I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone By myself by myself by myself I've got to find out what was mine again My heart is saying that it's time again And I have faith that I will shine again By myself I have faith in me Oh I know I'll make it By myself by myself
