What would you say if I told you I've always wanted to hold you I don't know what we're afraid of Nothing would change if we made love So I'll be your friend and I'll be your lover 'Cause I know in our hearts we agree We don't have to be one or the other Oh no we could be both to each other And yes it's a chance that we're taking Somebody's heart may be breaking But we can't stop what's inside us Our love for each other will guide us So I'll be your friend and I'll be your lover 'Cause I know in our hearts we agree We don't have to be one or the other I've been through you and you've been through me And sometimes a friend is the hardest to see But we always know when it's laid on the line Nobody else is as easy to find So I'll be your friend and I'll be your lover 'Cause I'll be your friend and I'll be your lover 'Cause I know in our hearts we agree We don't have to be one or the other Oh no we could be both to each other
