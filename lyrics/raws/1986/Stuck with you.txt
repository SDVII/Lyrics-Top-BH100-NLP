We've had some fun Yes we've had our ups and downs Been down that rocky road But here we are still around We thought about someone else But neither one took the bait We thought about breaking up Now we know it's much too late We are bound by all the rest Like the same phone number All the same friends And the same address  Yes it's true  I am happy to be stuck with you  Yes it's true  I'm so happy to be stuck with you  'Cause I can see  That you're happy to be stuck with me We've had our doubts We never took them seriously And we've had our ins and outs But that's the way it's s'posed to be We thought about giving up  But we could never stay away We thought about breaking up  But now we know it's much too late And it's no great mystery  If we change our minds Eventually It's back to you and me  Yes it's true  I am happy to be stuck with you  Yes it's true  I'm so happy to be stuck with you  'Cause I can see  That you're happy to be stuck with me We are bound by all the rest Like the same phone number All the same friends And the same address  Yes it's true  I am happy to be stuck with you  Yes it's true  I'm so happy to be stuck with you  'cause I can see  That you're happy to be stuck with me  I'm so happy to be stuck with you  I'm happy to be stuck with you  Happy to be stuck with you
