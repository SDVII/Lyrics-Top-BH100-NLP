Sitting with the thinker Just trying to work it out It's a traffic jam of the brain Makes you want to scream and shout Presidential party No one wants to dance Looking for a new star To put you in a trance Let's go all the way Let's go all the way Let's go all the way Workin' in a factory Eight days a week Tryin' to make dollar Down what a beat Cartoon capers Happen in reality Rich man poor man Livin' in fantasy Let's go all the way Let's go all the way Let's go all the way Livin' in New York Looks like an apple core  Asphalt jungle Got to be a man of war California dreamers Sinkin' in the sand  The Hollywood squares are Living in Disneyland Let's go all the way Let's go all the way Let's go all the way Let's go all the way Let's go all the way Let's go all the way We need heaven on earth today We can make a better way Let's go all the way Go all the way Let's go all the way Na na na na Na na na na Na na na na
