And I never thought I'd feel this way And as far as I'm concerned I'm glad I got the chance to say That I do believe I love you And if I should ever go away Well then close your eyes and try to feel The way we do today And then if you can remember Keep smiling keep shining Knowing you can always count on me for sure That's what friends are for For good times and bad times I'll be on your side forever more That's what friends are for Well you came and opened me And now there's so much more I see And so by the way I thank you Whoa and then for the times when we're apart Well then close your eyes and know These words are coming from my heart And then if you can remember oh Keep smiling keep shining Knowing you can always count on me for sure That's what friends are for In good times in bad times I'll be on your side forever more Oh that's what friends are for Keep smiling keep shining Knowing you can always count on me for sure That's what friends are for For good times and bad times I'll be on your side forever more That's what friends are for Keep smilin' keep shining Knowing you can always count on me oh for sure 'Cause I tell you that's what friends are for For good times and for bad times I'll be on your side forever more That's what friends are for
