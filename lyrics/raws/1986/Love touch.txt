Oh baby I don't know why But somehow I always seem to get Tangled up in my pride But oh baby we're not that blind Deep down inside you know This love's worth one more try Don't push it all aside 'Cause I wanna be good for you Didn't mean to be bad But darling I'm still the best That you ever had Just give me a chance To let me show you how much I wanna give you my love touch love touch Why can't I climb your walls And find somewhere to hide Can't I knock down your door And drag myself inside I'll light your candles baby And maybe I'll light your life I wanna feel the breathless end You come to every night This ever changing love Is pushing me too far I feel the need to reach you Right now wherever you are These empty arms are getting stronger Every day believe me baby They won't let you get away No they won't let you get away 'Cause I wanna be good for you Didn't mean to be bad But darling I'm still the best That you ever had Just give me a chance To let me show you how much I wanna give you my love touch love touch I wanna give you my love touch You know it don't matter Who's right or who's wrong Guess we're gonna find out If this love is strong Just give me a chance To win back your trust I wanna give you my love touch love touch I wanna give you my love touch love touch I wanna give you my love touch love touch Ooh you're gonna get a ooh you're gonna get a big love touch
