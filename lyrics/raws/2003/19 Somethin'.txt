I saw Star Wars at least 8 times Had the pac man pattern memorized And I ve seen the stuff they put inside Stretch Armstrong I was Roger Stauback back in my back yard Had a shoebox full of baseball cards And a couple of Evil Kinevil scars On my right arm Well I was a kid when Elvis died And my mama cried Chorus It was 1970 something In the world that I grew up in Farrah Faucett hair do days Bell bottoms and 8 track tapes Lookin back now I can see me And oh man did I look cheesy But I wouldn t trade those days for nothin It was 1970 something It was the dawning of a new decade When we got our first microwave And Dad broke down and finally shaved Those sideburns off I took the stickers off of my Rubix cube Watched MTV all afternoon My first love was Daisy Duke In them cut off jeans A Space Shuttle fell out of the sky And the whole world cried Chorus It was 1980 something In the world that I grew up in Skating rinks and Black Trans Ams Big hair and parachute pants Lookin back now I can see me And oh man did I look cheesy But I wouldn t trade those days for nothin It was 1980 something Now I got a mortgage and an SUV But all this responsibility Makes me wish sometimes Sometimes Chorus It was 1980 something In the world that I grew up in Skating rinks and Black Trans Ams Big hair and parachute pants Lookin back now I can see me And oh man did I look cheesy But I wouldn t trade those days for nothin It was 1980 something 1970 something Aw it was 19 Something
