When the world wasn t upside down I could take all the time I had But I m not gonna wait When a moment can vanish so fast Cause every kiss Is a kiss you can never get back Lift me up In your eyes If you told me that is what Heaven is Well you d be right I ve been waiting forever for this This is the night When the answer to all my dreams Is as close as a touch away Why am I here Holding back what I m trying to say Lift me up In your eyes If you told me that is what Heaven is Well you d be right Hold me close To your heart I would go with you to the ends of the earth And we ll fly I ve been waiting forever for this This is the night This is the night where we capture forever And all our tomorrows begin After tonight We will never be lonely again Lift me up In your eyes If you told me that is what Heaven is Well you d be right Hold me close To your heart I would go with you to the ends of the earth And we ll fly I ve been waiting forever for this This is the night
