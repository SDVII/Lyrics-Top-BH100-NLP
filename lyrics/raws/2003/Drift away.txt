 Day after day I m more confused Yet I look for the light through the pourin rain You know that s a game that I hate to lose And I m feelin the strain Oh ain t it a shame Oh give me the beat boys and free my soul I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away Give me the beat boys and free my soul I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away Won t you take me away Beginin to think that I m wastin time I don t understand the things I do The world outside looks so unkind And I m countin on you You can carry me through Oh give me the beat boys and free my soul I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away Give me the beat boys and free my soul I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away Won t you take me away And when my mind is free You know a melody can move me When I m feelin blue The guitars come in through to soothe me Thanks for the joy that you ve given me I want you to know that I believe in your song Your rhythm and rhyme and harmony You helped me along Oh you re makin me strong Oh give me the beat boys and free my soul I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away And give me the beat boys and free my soul I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away Give me the beat boys and free my soul I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away Give me the beat boys and free my soul I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away Yeah won t you take me Won t you take me I wanna drift away I wanna drift away I wanna drift away Take me home Let me drift away Won t you take me away
