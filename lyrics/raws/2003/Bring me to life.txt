 How can you see into my eyes like open doors Leading you down into my core Where I ve become so numb without a soul My spirit s sleeping somewhere cold Until you find it there and lead it back home Wake me up inside Wake me up inside Call my name and save me from the dark Bid my blood to run Before I come undone Save me from the nothing I ve become Now that I know what I m without You can t just leave me Breathe into me and make me real Bring me to life Wake me up inside Wake me up inside Call my name and save me from the dark Bid my blood to run Before I come undone Save me from the nothing I ve become Bring me to life Bring me to life Frozen inside without your touch Without your love darling Only you are the life Among the dead All this time I can t believe I couldn t see Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me I ve been sleeping a thousand years it seems Got to open my eyes to everything Without a thought without a voice without a soul There must be something more Bring me to life Wake me up inside Wake me up inside Call my name and save me from the dark Bid my blood to run Before I come undone Save me from the nothing I ve become Bring me to life Bring me to life
