 In your arms I can still feel the way you want me when you hold me I can still hear the words you whispered when you told me I can stay right here forever in your arms And there ain t no way I m letting you go now And there ain t no way And there ain t no how I ll never see that day Cause I m keeping you forever and for always We will be together all of our days Wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face Always Mmmm baby In your heart I can still hear a beat for every time you kiss me And when we re apart I know how much you miss me I can feel your love for me in your heart And there ain t no way I m letting you go now And there ain t no way And there ain t no how I ll never see that day Cause I m keeping you forever and for always We will be together all of our days Wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face Always Oh Yeah Wanna wake up every morning Oh In your eyes I can still see the look of the one who really loves me The one who wouldn t put anything Else in the world above me I can still see love for me in your eyes And there ain t no way I m letting you go now And there ain t no way And there ain t no how I ll never see that day Cause I m keeping you forever and for always We will be together all of our days Wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face I m keeping you forever and for always We will be together all of our days Wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face I m keeping you forever and for always Oh I m keeping you forever Got to keep you baby Forever In your arms
