There was a time in my life When I opened my eyes and there you were You were more than a dream I could reach out a touch you Girl that was long ago There are something s that I guess I ll never know When you love someone You got to learn to let them go When I dream about you That s when everything s all right Your in my arms Here next to me forever When I dream about you Girl you never go away Just close my eyes Wait for my dreams Cause I still love loving you How can I get you to see That I m falling apart Since you ve been gone I can never be sure I could ever let go Your love is much to strong There are something s that I guess I ll never know When you love someone You got to learn to let them go When I dream about you That s when everything s all right Your in my arms Here next to me forever When I dream about you Girl you never go away Just close my eyes Wait for my dreams Cause I still love loving you There are something s that I guess I ll never know When you love someone You got to learn to let them go When I dream about you That s when everything s all right Your in my arms Here next to me forever When I dream about you Girl you never go away Just close my eyes Wait for my dreams Cause I still love loving you
