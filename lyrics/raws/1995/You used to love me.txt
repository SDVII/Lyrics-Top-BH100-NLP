 I remember the way you used to love me I remember the days you used to love me You don t appreciate the time I put into this love affair of ours baby I couldn t let you walk around Thinking it s alright to let me down I remember the way you used to love me I remember the days you used to love me I gave you all my precious love And anything you wanted from me You didn t hear me calling out Calling for your warm affection after all this time You can t deny what I m feeling is real And I stood around stood by your side Went through all the hurt and pain And you turned and walked away I remember the way you used to love me I remember the days you used to love me Yeah yeah oh Can t give up on the way you used to give it to me Give it to me What a feeling it s so real I remember the way you used to love me I remember the days you used to love me You didn t hear me calling out And that s not what love s about I remember you used to love me You used to love me every day Now your love has gone away I remember I remember I remember the way you used to love me I remember the days you used to love me Oh I remember the way you used to love me Oh baby you used to walk holding my hand Cause you used to be my man I remember I remember the days you used to love me Didn t hear me calling out And that s not what love s about I remember I remember the way you used to love me I remember the days you used to love me
