Brokenhearted I m young but I m wise enough to know That you don t fall in love overnight oh yeah That s why I thought if I took my time That everything in love would be right But as soon as I closed my eyes I was saying to love Goodbye But I guess I m lonely Brokenhearted Life s not over I can start again While I m lonely brokenhearted It s a hurting thing to get over No more empty conversations Next time I will be totally sure oh yeah Don t want the pain of falling in and out of love It s more than my poor heart should endure So I ll listen to all advice And remember each time I cry That I guess I m lonely Brokenhearted Life s not over I can start again While I m lonely brokenhearted It s a hurting thing to get over Lonely Brokenhearted Life s not over I can start again While I m lonely brokenhearted It s a hurting thing to get over Lonely Brokenhearted So I ll listen to all advice And remember each time I cry oh Lonely Brokenhearted Life s not over I can start again While I m lonely brokenhearted It s a hurting thing to get over Lonely Brokenhearted Life s not over I can start again While I m lonely brokenhearted It s a hurting thing to get over Lonely Brokenhearted Life s not over I can start again While I m lonely brokenhearted It s a hurting thing to get over to get over Only brokenhearted
