Close your eyes  take a deep breathe  Open your heart  and whisper I love you I love you Tell me you love me tell me you love me You love me You love me Hold me tight  don't say good night  don't say Good night  We've got the time Everything's gonna be alright Just hold me darling never let me go and tell me You love me you love me you love me Oh no no  even though  This is not the way I want it to be But if you must pretend That's alright with me Close your eyes  take a deep breathe  Open your heart  and whisper I love you I love you Tell me you love me tell me you love me You love me You love me
