There's something happening here But what it is ain't exactly clear There's a man with a gun over there Telling me I got to beware I think it's time we stop Children what's that sound  Everybody look   what's going down  There's battle lines being drawn Nobody's right if everybody's wrong Young people speaking their minds Getting so much resistance from behind It's time we stop Hey what's that sound  Everybody look   what's going down  What a field day for the heat A thousand people in the street Singing songs and carrying signs Mostly say  hooray for our side  It's time we stop Hey what's that sound  Everybody look   what's going down  Paranoia strikes deep Into your life it will creep It starts when you're always afraid Step out of line the men come and take you away We better stop Hey what's that sound  Everybody look   what's going We better stop Hey what's that sound  Everybody look   what's going We better stop Now what's that sound  Everybody look   what's going We better stop Children what's that sound  Everybody look   what's going down
