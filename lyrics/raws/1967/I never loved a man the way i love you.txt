You're a no good heart breaker You're a liar and you're a cheat And I don't know why I let you do these things to me My friends keep telling me That you ain't no good But oh they don't know That I'd leave you if I could I guess I'm uptight And I'm stuck like glue Cause I ain't never I ain't never I ain't never no no  Some time ago I thought You had run out of fools But I was so wrong You got one that you'll never lose The way you treat me is a shame How could you hurt me so bad Baby you know that I'm the best thing That you ever had Kiss me once again Don't you never never say that we we're through Cause I ain't never Never Never no no  I can't sleep at night And I can't eat a bite I guess I'll never be free Since you got your hooks in me I ain't never loved a man  Ain't never had a man hurt me so bad No Well this is what I'm going to do about it
