A GREAT number of warriors with quivers slung on their shoulders fill the vestibule of the palace of T mora the residence of the kings of Erin and the bards are singing to the accompaniment of their golden harps  the deeds performed in war and in the chase by the brave Morna the sovereign of the Emerald Isles surrounded by the blue waves  The harps of the bards are silenced  the warriors are ranged in two long files  the gates of the palace are flung open and the aged Morna appears between his two sons L mor and Armin  The p  151 people flock to gaze on their king and welcome him with acclamations of deep affection because Morna is the well beloved of all as his name signifies in the harmonious language of the verdant isles  The hair and beard of the king are white but the snow of seventy winters has been powerless to bend the limbs of the athlete king well developed by labour and a sober life  The loving people have also a welcome for the princes who accompany the ancient for beautiful in body and soul are L mor and Armin  L mor possesses a face that is fair to behold as the snow which crowns the heights of Carmora  his hair is golden as the rays of the sun and his eyes are blue like the flower of the flax  They depart from T mora followed by the warriors and blessed by the women  The old men and the children gaze after their retreating forms with loving eyes and hearts until they become lost in the woods of Lena  But they are not proceeding to war  no  for see the women do not weep on beholding their departure  The wild boar of rough skin and long tusks is the enemy against which they are going to wrestle in the forests of Lena  See them as they become lost in the fastnesses as soon as the dogs announce the presence of the giant of the woods  The king goes one way and L mor and Armin go another  The bugle of the keepers also announce the appearance of the wild boar  And the boar runs runs runs destroying with his formidable p  152 tusks every dog which dares to approach him repelling all the arrows directed against his hard rough skin  L mor has separated himself from his brother as he had done previously from his father and one hour had already been spent by the tired out huntsmen in scouring the dense wood unable to vanquish the boar  The bugle announces to L mor that the animal is running towards where he is and the gallant huntsman prepares his bow  The tangled brushwood is seen moving at a short distance from him  the enormous head of the boar is descried and the arrow of L mor pierces the air  A cry of pain is heard and L mor hastens to despatch the animal  but the boar is not in the spot aimed at by the arrow and the cry of pain is repeated some distance further  L mor advances and on separating the tangled growth of briars and brushwood behind which issued the wail a cry of immense sorrow bursts from his breast on seeing that his father the king of the green isles the beloved of all and of none more than of L mor is lying on the ground in a dying condition his noble breast pierced by the dart shot from the bow of L mor  L mor beseeches help for his father invoking the protection of heaven in behalf of the dying old man endeavours to return back his life  that life which is fast ebbing away  and he weeps on seeing his impotence and his soul is filled with despair  p  153 II  They are returning to the palace of T mora the princes of the Emerald Isles and the warriors who went with them to the woods of Lena  but the bards who went out to receive them when they perceived them returning in the far distance do not strike their golden harps nor do they welcome the huntsmen with songs of praise  Silent and sorrowful do the huntsmen and the bards arrive and on learning the cause of this silence and grief the women and the old men and the children fill the air with their laments and their wails of sorrow  Morna the beloved of all returns a lifeless body conducted by his warriors laid on a litter of funereal cypress and L mor and Armin appear to be dying of grief  The ancients the chieftains of the tribes of Erin assemble together on the following day in T mora and after a long conference they come and stand before L mor the heir to the sovereignty of the Emerald Isles   Prince  spoke the oldest of the chiefs  although by our laws a parricide is condemned to death thou must not die because if thine arrow did wound thy father it was not done willingly  but the crown must not be placed on the brow of one who is stained with the blood of his father and of his king nor can he dwell amongst us  The crown of Morna must rest on the stainless p  154 brow of Armin  To morrow at daybreak a ship will await thee in port provisioned and manned  Depart in her for ever from our isles and may heaven protect thee wheresoever the wind and wave may take thee to   L mor accedes to the decision of the chieftains of the tribes and delivers himself up to the mercy of the winds and of the waves with no better company than his own sorrow his hope in heaven which knew his innocence and two loyal servitors who had willed to share his misfortunes  The ship deficient of a skilful pilot sailed on for days and nights and even months upon the boundless solitudes of the ocean cast about like a toy at the mercy of swelling waves and the fury of the winds  Thirst at length begins to parch up L mor and his servitors who have no more water to drink or to cool their parched lips but the salt sea water  But just as the last ray of hope of discovering land had been extinguished and they had abandoned all idea of meeting with the shore of any country whatever they perceived in the far distance amid the sea mists a coast backed by green mountains and they pushed on their ship towards that blessed land  That land was the one inhabited by the Cantabrians 1 the race of giants which five centuries p  155 earlier Rome the mistress of the world had been unable to vanquish despite all her power  The ship is closely approaching the shore  Beautiful is the land before them  more beautiful even than the isles of Erin is the continent which the prince and his loyal servitors hail with joy  The exiles leap from the ship on to the land and burst out in shouts of joy because beneath the shade of some immense leafy chestnut trees they perceive a fountain of running water clear as the crystalline roofs of the grottoes of Drumanar  The fresh water calms the heat which devours them  Peace comes over the soul and sleep visits their weary eyelids  They cast themselves on a green slope covered with flowers and soon fall asleep  III  Where goes the echeco jauna 1 of Bustuna as he abandons the cultivation of his fields and descends to the deserted shores of Mundaca followed by those who were assisting him at his work  Where goes the echeco jauna in such haste  From the mountain heights he has seen a little ship tossed by the waves and dashing itself against the rocks and as his heart is compassionate and hospitable he runs flies to succour the wrecked ones whom he p  156 supposes must be battling with death on the shore  He stops as he descends to the plain and those who came with him also  Three strangers are sleeping close to the fountain under the shade of the chestnut trees and the echeco jauna remains there in order to watch over and guard their steep  The sons of the green isles awake and they ask of the echeco jauna what land that is which the winds and the waves have brought them to in their ship  And on learning that it is the land of the invincible Cantabrians they raise their lips to heaven and thank God for having conducted them to the country of the first heroes of the universe  Under the roof of Bustuna they find an hospitable asylum those exiles from Erin  but very quickly does it become known throughout the Euskarian mountains that among them dwells a son of kings and the aged Lekobide the chieftain of the Eskaldunac 1 and descendant of the glorious leader of the same name who humbled the pride of the C sars and whom the Basque people sing praises in their songs sends messengers to the Prince of Erin to offer him a home in the valley of Padura  p  157 L mor contemplates with delight the supreme happiness of the land on reaching the dwelling of the Basque chieftain  An aureole of glory encircles the venerable brow of Lekobide and another of beauty and chastity that of the youthful Luz the daughter of the chieftain of the Eskaldunac  Months have passed since L mor came to dwell in the home of Lekobide and for months has he been striving to quit the valley of Padura because as a good knight and a good Christian he is ashamed to live in idleness meanwhile that the sons of Agar are trampling on the holy cross beyond the Ebro  For months has he wished to offer his arm to Fernan Gonzalez the Count de Castile but he is always held back by the pleadings of Luz and Lekobide  and more than all is he detained by a mysterious power which dwells in his heart  Warlike exercises and the chase restrains his steps  When departing from Padura he wends his steps towards the lofty mountains that command the view of the valley to pursue the wild boar and the deer Luz goes to the window with saddened looks to watch the stranger from the valley and the stranger turns back seeking Luz at the window  IV  The Eskaldunac are free free as the breeze and the birds of their mountains  They have no lord to whom p  158 they owe vassalage nor do they possess other laws than those written in the consciences of their chiefs who judge the culprit and adjust contentions under the shadow of the holy tree of Guernica  Beyond the hierarchy of virtue and of intelligence and of age there is but one hierarchy in the land of the Eskaldunac  The Eskaldunac elect a chief who is ever ready to lead them to the combat whenever the stranger invades their free land  and this glorious title they bestowed on Lekobide more than half a century before in consideration of his virtue his intelligence his valour and his glorious name  One day when the Euskaro patricians were assembled together under the holy oak of Guernica one of them remarked that Lekobide was aged and impotent and therefore incapable to take the command of the armies of the Eskaldunac on the day when the stranger should invade the land  Then a patrician of a century old spoke in the name of the assembly   Fifteen years have passed since Leyal  the most valiant and loyal dog of our mountains watched day and night at the door of his master   Leyal  is old  said one day the echeco jauna and on that night a new guardian was installed in the post in which Leyal  had grown old   The fox which had been scared away from afar by Leyal  fifteen years ago and which he had scented p  159 from a great distance came that very night unfelt by the young dog and ate up the fowls of the echeco jauna  And Leyal  who sad and broken in heart had left the fern bed in which he had slept for fifteen years at the door of the homestead in order that a stranger should occupy his post was found dead on the following morning although the echeco jauna had prepared a bed for him softer and more sheltered than the one in which he had lain for fifteen years   Thus spoke the patrician of a century old and since then no one ever remarked that Lekobide was aged  Neither Lekobide himself remembered his age because the youthfulness of his spirit does not permit him to think on the age of his strong arm  But hark  a low rumour is heard and an unusual agitation unknown for years spreads across the valleys and along the range of the Basque mountains and numerous scouts their hearts full of indignation hasten to the door of Lekobide calling out    Quidaria  1 a formidable army appears on the cordillera of Ordu a and alas  for the Eskaldunac should the irrinzi 2 not be quickly heard on our mountains  Lekobide rises up brimming over with wrath   Blow the five bugle horns on the five Basque mountains  for p  160 none must reach the Tree Malato of those who would dare in warfare to trample down our free dwellings  Give me my coat of mail and the lance which seventy years ago accompanied me to the combat   And Lekobide quickly puts on the coat of mail and his body bends beneath the weight of his armour  Lekobide grasps the lance but his arm is powerless to hold it  Then does the glorious chieftain remember his age and trembles  and humbled and despairing he falls down at the threshold of the door  Meanwhile the alarm flies along the Basque mountains and valleys and in answer to the call to war many Basque warriors are coming down to the valley of Padura imploring their revered chieftain to lead them to battle  A ray of hope suddenly illumines the venerable countenance of Lekobide which had been so full of despair   Prince of Erin cried the old man addressing the son of Morna  take my coat of mail and my lance and fill my place of command at the head of the Euskaro legions    Se or   replies L mor  I will fight against the enemies of thy land in which I have received such generous hospitality but it will be in the soldier's ranks  Seek a chieftain more worthy than I to lead thy warriors to the combat   All the Euscarian warriors who had descended from p  161 the mountains to the valley of Padura joined their pleadings to those of Lekobide but the modest Prince of Erin insists on marching to war only on condition of fighting  in the ranks with the humblest wrestler   As long as thou livest thou wilt be the leader and champion of the Eskaldunac because I am powerless to be so  said Lekobide with universal assent  but L mor still continues to refuse to accept the glorious title offered to him   Thou art the son of kings and art worthy to command vassals  exclaim the ancients of the twenty valleys gathered together in the valley of Padura   the free land of the Euskaro confers upon thee the sovereignty if thou dost consent to take the command of our armies   The prince of the green isles refuses the sovereignty of the Eskaldunac  And while all this contention takes place more scouts appear on the field to announce that the army of the enemy has passed the Tree Malato and are descending the mountain slopes like a raging sea carrying all that opposes its progress   Oh Prince of Erin   cries Lekobide  if in my veins flowed the blood of kings I would then tell thee  Lead the Eskaldunac legions on to battle cast out of our free land the stranger and on returning from the combat thou wilt sit at my hearth and I will bestow on thee the title of son   p  162 L mor directed a glance full of love and hope towards Luz  and as though he had read on the brow of the maiden the reply his soul yearned to hear he cried out as he donned the coat of mail and grasped the lance of Lekobide   Old man  may God permit me to be seated at thy hearth and hear from thy lips the name of son   V  Upon the five highest mountains of the free land is heard the blast of the trumpets and that warlike sound is answered throughout the valleys and mountains by the powerful irrinzi  Every man with sufficient strength to cast an arrow wield the sword the lance or battleaxe speedily rises up quits his house and proceeds toward the valley of Padura whose plains and heights can scarcely hold the thousands of Basques that are collecting together in answer to the call of their Country  This call or summons is not issued without good cause for the enemies are many and they are already approaching the valley of Padura as though to challenge the chieftain who they are well aware dwells there  The armies which invade the Basque mountains are not composed of those brave legions of Castile and Leon who so often planted the cross of Christ over the tents of the Mussulman  nor are they led by the kings p  163 of Leon or the Counts of Castile  These legions are composed of low adventurers who defame the Christian name from the banks of the Ebro to the shores of the Tagus and are commanded by Ordo o the Wicked the vile usurper of the crown of Sancho el Craso and who cast forth from his Leonese throne wishes to drown his disappointment in the noble blood of the Eskaldunac and raise up on the Basque mountains a new throne upon which to sit  The Basque army led by Jaun Zuria as the people style the Prince of Erin goes out to encounter the stranger who is already appearing on the mountain heights that overlook the valley of Padura and Sancho de Esteguiz the lord of the Duranguesado leaves his palace of Tarisa to lead the Duranguese who are longing to fight by the side of their brother tribes commanded by the prince  The combat is a fierce one and its frightful din thunders throughout the hitherto peaceful mountains of the Euskaros  A dense cloud of arrows obscures the sunlight enormous boulders of rocks wrenched by the herculean arms of the Eskaldunac are cast upon the armies of Ordo o dismembering and crushing and terrifying them  The axe and the lance the swords of the Basque warriors are fast cutting down the invading legions on the broken rocks of Padura  But the desperation of Ordo o incites him to make a supreme effort to reanimate p  164 the courage of the adventurers and the victory is still undecided   Death to the leader of the Eskaldunac   cries Ordo o  and then the victory will be ours   And he runs to encounter Jaun Zuria who at the same time fights and commands his army in the thickest of the fray  The son of the kings of Erin goes out in his turn to meet the ambitious chief of the invaders and closes with him in a fierce match  The lance of Lekobide wielded with Titanic force by the Prince of Erin pierces through the breast of Ordo o who expires uttering a roar of desperation which resounds throughout the mountains of Padura like that of a wounded lion  But alas  a stone flung by the enemy wounds the noble forehead of the lord of the Duranguesado for whose life the Prince of Erin would willingly have given his own  Disorder reigns now in the disbanded legions of the stranger and they flee in terror back from whence they came marking their footprints with blood and fire  The Eskaldunac follow them to the cordillera of Ordo o and there wearied with so much slaughter and beholding their country once more happy and free they return to rest and to celebrate their glorious triumph beneath the shades of the Tree Malato  p  165 VI  Nearly ten centuries have passed since the Eskaldunac led by the exile of Erin sent a thrill of joy and triumph among the people on the fields of Padura  Should you desire to visit these fields do not seek on the map for the name of Padura because they have changed this name for that of Arrigorriaga which in the rich and venerable language of the Euskaro is equivalent to reddened stones  The rocks which bristle on the tops of the mountains of the ancient Padura presented for a long time the colour of the blood which the hordes of Ordo o the Wicked poured upon them and for this reason was the ancient name of Padura altered to that of Arrigorriaga  Proceed to the parochial church of the valley of Arrigorriaga and there close to the font of holy water you will see a sepulchre  Ask the simple villager who it is that reposes in that sepulchre and he will tell you that there lies a prince called Ordo o who strove to rob the Basque people of their liberties and was killed by Jaun Zuria the first Lord of Biscay  After this examine the dusty archives of the temple and if you understand the changeless and eternal language of the Eskaldunac you may read in some worm eaten parchments yellowed by age that in this temple were joined together the daughter of Lekobide with the son of a King of Erin
