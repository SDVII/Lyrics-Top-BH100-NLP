I've been lonely too long I've been lonely too long In the past it's come and gone I feel like I can't go on without Love I've been lonely too long   I've been lonely too long   As I look back I can see me lost and searching Now I find that I can choose I'm free  Oh Yeah  So funny I just have to laugh All my troubles been torn in half I been lonely too long   Lonely too long   In the past it's come and gone I feel like I can't go on without love  lonely too long I've been lonely too long   Just see me now Makes it worth the time I've waited She was all I need to make me see Oh Yeah  I keep hopin' with all my mind Everything gonna turn out right I've been lonely too long   I've been lonely too long   Now look at me Gliding through this world of beauty Everything I do brings ecstasy Oh Yeah  No wonder I could die I feel like I'm 'bout ten miles high  I've been lonely too long   Lonely too long   Found myself somebody   Don't have to be alone no more   Don't have to alone no more no more   He's been lonely He's been Lonely
