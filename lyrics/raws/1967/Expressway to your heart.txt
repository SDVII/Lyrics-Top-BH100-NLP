I've been tryin' to get to you for a long time 'Cause constantly you been on my mind I was thinkin' about a shortcut I could take But it seems like I made a mistake But I was wrong Ooh took too long I got caught in the rush hour Then fellas started to shower You with love and affection Now you won't look in my direction On the expressway to your heart That expressway not the best way At five o'clock It's much too crowded  It was much too crowded  So crowded  It was much too crowded oh yeah  So so so crowded  There's too many ahead of me They're all tryin' to get in front of me I thought that I could find a clear road ahead But I found stop lights instead But I was wrong Baby took too long I got caught in the rush hour Then fellas started to shower You with love and affection Come on look in my direction On the expressway to your heart That expressway not the best way At five o'clock It's much too crowded  Much too crowded  So crowded  No room for me
