There's a kind of hush All over the world tonight All over the world You can hear the sound of lovers in love You know what I mean Just the two of us and nobody else in sight There's nobody else And I'm feeling good just holding you tight So listen very carefully Move closer now And you will see what I mean It isn't a dream The only sound that you will hear Is when I whisper in your ear I love you forever and ever There's a kind of hush All over the world tonight All over the world You can hear the sound of lovers in love La la la La la la La la la So listen very carefully Move closer now And you will see what I mean It isn't a dream The only sound that you will hear Is when I whisper in your ear I love you forever and ever There's a kind of hush All over the world tonight All over the world People just like us are fallin' in love Yeah they're fallin' in love Hush they're fallin' in love Hush
