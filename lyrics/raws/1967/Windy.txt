Who's peeking out from under a stairway Calling a name that's lighter than air Who's bending down to give me a rainbow Everyone knows it's Windy Who's tripping down the streets of the city Smiling at everybody she sees Who's reaching out to capture a moment Everyone knows it's Windy And Windy has stormy eyes That flash at the sound of lies And Windy has wings to fly Above the clouds Above the clouds And Windy has stormy eyes That flash at the sound of lies And Windy has wings to fly Above the clouds Above the clouds Who's tripping down the streets of the city Smiling at everybody she sees Who's reaching out to capture a moment Everyone knows it's Windy Who's tripping down the streets of the city Smiling at everybody she sees Who's reaching out to capture a moment Everyone knows it's Windy Who's tripping down the streets of the city Smiling at everybody she sees Who's reaching out to capture a moment Everyone knows it's Windy Who's tripping down the streets of the city Smiling at everybody she sees Who's reaching out to capture a moment Everyone knows it's Windy
