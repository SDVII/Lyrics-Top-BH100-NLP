Every day there's something new  Honey to keep me loving you  And with every passing minute Ah baby so much joy wrapped up in it Wo Heaven must have sent you from above Wo heaven must have sent your precious love And I I've got a song to sing  Telling the world about the joy you bring  And you gave me a reason for living  And ooo you taught me you taught me the meaning of giving Wo Heaven must have sent you from above Wo heaven must have sent your precious love To find a love like ours is rare these days Cause you've shown me happiness yes in so many ways I look in the mirror and I'm glad to see Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be What you've given me I could never return  Cause there's so much girl I have yet to learn  And I wanna show I wanna show my appreciation  Cause when I found you I found a new inspiration Heaven must have sent you from above Wo heaven must have sent your precious love Wo Heaven must have sent you from above Wo heaven must have sent your precious love
