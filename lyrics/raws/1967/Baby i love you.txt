If you want my lovin' If you really do Don't be afraid baby Just ask me You know I'm gonna give it to you Oh and I do declare  I wanna see you with it Stretch out your arms little boy You're gonna get it 'Cause I love you Ain't no doubt about it Baby I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you Baby I love you If you feel you wanna kiss me Go right ahead I don't mind All you got to do is Snap your fingers And I'll come runnin' I ain't lyin'  And I heard you once Little boy you know you got it I'd deny my own self Before I see you without it 'Cause I love you Ain't no doubt about it Baby I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you Baby I love you Someday you might want to run away And leave me sitting here crying But if it's all the same to you baby I'm gonna stop you from saying goodbye Baby I love you Baby I need you Said I want you Got to have you baby Don't let your neighbors  Tell you I don't want you Don't let you
