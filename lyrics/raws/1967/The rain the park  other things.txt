I saw her sitting in the rain Raindrops falling on her She didn't seem to care She sat there and smiled at me Then I knew  She could make me happy  Flowers in her hair  Flowers everywhere  Oh I don't know just why She simply caught my eye She seemed so sweet and kind She crept into my mind I knew I had to say hello  She smiled up at me  And she took my hand And we walked through the park alone And I knew  She had make me happy  Flowers in her hair  Flowers everywhere  Oh I don't know just why She simply caught my eye She seemed so sweet and kind She crept into my mind Suddenly the sun broke through  I turned around she was gone  And all I had left Was one little flower in my hand But I knew  She had make me happy  Flowers in her hair  Flowers everywhere  Was she reality Or just a dream to me Her love showed me the way To find a sunny day Was she reality Or just a dream to me
