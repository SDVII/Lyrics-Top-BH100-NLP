 There is a woman in Somalia Scraping for pearls on the roadside There's a force stronger than nature Keeps her will alive This is how she's dying She's dying to survive Don't know what she's made of I would like to be that brave   Sade  Pearls   Never believe that a few caring people can't change the world  For indeed that's all who ever have   Margaret Mead I will donate all of my proceeds from The Hard Thing About Hard Things to American Jewish World Service to support their efforts to help women fight for their basic rights throughout the world  Since there are many important causes I thought that it would be worth explaining why I am supporting this one  When I was 11 years old I was exposed to chronic cruelty on a global scale  I watched the miniseries  Roots  based on Alex Haley's bestselling novel about slavery in the United States  I was riveted and horrified  It was my first real introduction to slavery and I could not believe what I was seeing  I saw families broken apart as they were sold to different owners  I saw slaves pleading for their lives only to be brutalized and killed  How could anybody be so cruel  How could everybody sit by and watch it happen  How was this even possible  I could not have been more shocked  I was deeply disturbed by the whole experience and sought to find out how it happened  I studied humankind's long history with slavery  I learned that in the 1600s 75  of the world's population was enslaved  I learned that the Caribbean form of the African slave trade was far more brutal than the U S  version  I studied the complex economics of slavery and why it was difficult to unwind once started  I began to wonder how slavery ever ended  Then I began to study the abolitionists  Men like former slave ship captain John Newton who later wrote the song  Amazing Grace   People like the great Thomas Clarkson who at times seemed to be alone in taking on the world  I learned how a few unimaginably brave people took on the entire globe and its brutal institution  They did not care about the twisted history or corrupt cultures that created slavery  They just wanted it stopped  Clarkson took great personal risk in traveling by boat back and forth across the Atlantic to record and tell the story of slavery for no reason other than he wanted it ended  He dedicated his life to stopping the cruelty  His story is among the most inspirational in human history  It had to be because the most incredible thing about slavery was how it ended  An institution that was embedded into human culture endorsed by the Bible promoted by the Qur an pervasive in society and embedded in the global economy was taken on and defeated by a movement started by a tiny number of people  These brave souls had no Twitter or Facebook  They had no Internet or telephones or automobiles but they organized people across the world and largely stopped slavery globally  After understanding how slavery ended I promised myself that if something like that ever happened in my time I would be part of the group who tried to stop it  Sadly something like slavery is happening in my time  It's not happening in the United States but it is happening and the victims are women  In many parts of the world women are literally owned by men  Women do not enjoy basic rights are denied access to education can be arbitrarily raped robbed and killed and live in fear with no chance for self determination  A few revealing statistics    Every year 10 million girls under the age 18 enter into early and forced marriages   2 million girls a year undergo genital cutting   Two thirds of the world's illiterate adults are women   Women constitute about 70  of the world s absolute poor  Meanwhile the rhetoric deployed in resistance to women's rights is eerily reminiscent of resistance to freeing slaves  Consider this statement from the Muslim Brotherhood in resistance to a U N  declaration calling for an end to violence against women  This declaration if ratified would lead to complete disintegration of society and would certainly be the final step in the intellectual and cultural invasion of Muslim countries eliminating the moral specificity that helps preserve cohesion of Islamic societies  And compare it to this poem written in defense of slavery in England in 1789  If our slave trade had gone there's an end to our lives Beggars all we must be our children and wives No ships from our ports their proud sails e'er would spread And our streets grown with grass where the cows might be fed  Like Thomas Clarkson and the abolitionists Ruth Messinger and AJWS are starting at the grass roots level but are already making great progress  Consider Rehana Adib  At age 12 she was raped by a group of older relatives  She bravely told her father but he responded by arranging for her to marry a middle aged man a match designed to protect her security and reputation  Like many other girls her age she was forced to drop out of school and was expected to be a subservient wife and mother  She was not free to make choices about her daily life and her own future  But Rehana refused to be silent  She found a women s organization in her neighborhood and began to learn about her rights  She took workshops in leadership and activism and gained the courage to speak out about her experiences  By the time Rehana was 18 she was an active member of the local women s movement and was already helping other girls overcome the challenges they faced  Although her family and community criticized her work at first she slowly gained their respect and is now looked to as a leader in her community  In 2005 Rehana founded her own organization Astitva in Muzzafarnagar a rural area in Uttar Pradesh India  With AJWS s support Astitva works today to stop both sexual violence and child marriage helping give girls a chance at a brighter future  The systematic cultural abuse of women worldwide must end  Let s end it   http   www theguardian
