The local rock group down the street Is trying hard to learn this song Seranade the weekend squire who just came out to mow his lawn Another Pleasant Valley Sunday Charcoal burning everywhere Rows of houses that are all the same And no one seems to care See Mrs  Gray she's proud today because her roses are in bloom Mr  Green he's so serene He's got a TV in every room Another Pleasant Valley Sunday Here in status symbol land Mothers complain about how hard life is And the kids just don't understand Creature comfort goals They only numb my soul and make it hard for me to see My thoughts all seem to stray to places far away I need a change of scenery Another Pleasant Valley Sunday Charcoal burning everywhere Another Pleasant Valley Sunday Here in status symbol land Another Pleasant Valley Sunday     Another Pleasant Valley Sunday     Another Pleasant Valley Sunday     Another Pleasant Valley Sunday     Another Pleasant Valley Sunday     Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
