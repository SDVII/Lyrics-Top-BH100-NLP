No no no No this can t be true I got this feeling and I just can t turn it loose That somebody s been getting next to you I don t want to walk around knowin I was your fool Cuz being the man that I am I just can t lose my cool My friends keep telling me about the things that s going on babe But deep in my heart baby I hope that I m wrong Yes I hope I m wrong but I know it babe CHORUS Somebody s sleeping in my bed my bed baby Somebody s takin my place Somebody s sleeping in my bed baby And you know just what I mean oh oh oh oh oh I come home early expecting your warm embrace But something is wrong cuz its written all over your face It hurt so bad when I walk through the door But cha know one damn thing baby I ain t coming back no more No no no Now don t try to tell me things are still the same Cuz when we made love I heard you call out his name Call out his name CHORUS Somebody s sleeping in my bed tonight baby Somebody s taking Sisqo s place Somebody s sleeping in my bed baby Somebody s taking my place yeah Girl I want you to know I gave you money and every li l thing that you need I gave you the world cuz you were my girl But you still ran out on me oh yeah CHORUS Said you re sleeping in my bed Messin with my head oooh Tell me why oh why oh why Why oh why oh why Why oh why oh why oh why oh why said you re Sleeping in my bed Messin with my head Somebody s takin my place Ohh yeah Now if you truly love me Then this would not be happenin Sleepin in my bed messin with my head Oh no no no no gotta let you go Yes I do baby babe Why d you do it Why d you do it I don t wanna be a fool no more
