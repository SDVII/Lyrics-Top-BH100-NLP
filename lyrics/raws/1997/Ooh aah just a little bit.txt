You re my love you re my sweetest thing Don t shy away don t shy away Every night makes me hate the days Can t get enough of your love Am I wrong am I so unkind Show me the way don t turn away I can t hide all these thoughts in my mind Every moment I m just thinking of you Chorus Just a little bit A little bit more Just a little bit You know what I m looking for Just a little bit A little bit more Just a little bit I ll give you love you can t ignore Feeling good let s go all the way It s got to be set me free But tonight let my body say Take it slow don t let it go How can I prove my love to you Baby please you re all I need Like a child but it s born out of phase Could act the angel but it wouldn t be true Chorus What can you do for me Oh what can you do Cos I feel so alive I feel your love inside ohhhh Just a little bit little bit more Just a little bit just a little Just a little bit little bit more Just a little bit woah Chorus to fade
