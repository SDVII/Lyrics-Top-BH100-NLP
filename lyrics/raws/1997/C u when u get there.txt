 Now I ve seen places and faces And things you ain t never thought about thinkin If you ain t peeped then you must be drinkin and smokin Pretending that you re loc in but you re broken let me get you open Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny But who s the dummy cause now you done lost the hustler A down ass brother done been replaced by a buster And though I got love for ya I know I can t trust ya Cause my crew is rollin hummers and your crew is rollin dusters And just because of that you act like you don t like the brother no more Uh I guess that s just the way it goes I ain t tryin to preach I believe I can reach But your mind ain t prepared I ll see you when you get there I ll see you when you get there If you ever get there See you when you get there I ll see you when you get there If you ever get there See you when you get there More temptation than faith I guess we livin for the day I seen a man get swept off his feet by a boy with an AK The situation so twisted everybody gettin lifted I m just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention So you don t get caught slippin when they come and do all the gettin Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart Some of us gotta run a little faster cause we gotta later start I d be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender If everybody s a sinner then everybody can be a winner No matter your rag color deep down we all brothers And regardless of the time somebody up there still love us I mma scuffle and struggle until I m breathless and weak I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something I ll be there when you get there waitin with the sounds bumpin You need to loosen up and live a little And if you got kids let them know how you feelin For your own sake give a little Oh you don t want to hear that you busy tryina stack And keep up with the Joneses takin advantage of your own The realest homies that you ve been knowing for the longest But some ain t missing a good thing until it s gone Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us We prefer to keep our eyes shut till it s right When there s something involved that we desire So hold your head up high if you re poor and righteous I know times seem strife and problems seem endless But at the times of despair we gotta put ourselves together And if you feel you re out of the game then you need to get back in it Cause nothing worse than a quitter You gotta face responsibility one day my brother So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition And put your vehicle in drive and stop by my side As we walk down the road of our destiny And the time comes to choose which shall it be The wide and crooked or the straight and narrow We got one voice to give and one life to live Stand up for something or lie down in your game Listen to the song that we sing It s up to you to make it big I guess I ll see you when you see me to fade
