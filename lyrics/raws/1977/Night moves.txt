I was a little too tall Could've used a few pounds Tight pants points hardly renown She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes And points all her own sitting way up high  hook  Way up firm and high Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy Workin' on mysteries without any clues Workin' on our night moves Trying' to make some front page drive in news Workin' on our night moves in the summertime In the sweet summertime We weren't in love oh no far from it We weren't searchin  for some pie in the sky summit We were just young and restless and bored Living by the sword And we'd steal away every chance we could To the backroom the alley the trusty woods I used her she used me But neither one cared We were getting our share Workin' on our night moves Trying to lose the awkward teenage blues Workin' on our night moves In the summertime In the sweet summer time summer time  Bridge  And oh the wonder Felt the lightning And we waited on the thunder Waited on the thunder I woke last night to the sound of thunder How far off I sat and wondered Started humming a song from 1962 Ain't it funny how the night moves When you just don't seem to have as much to lose Strange how the night moves With autumn closing in  coda  Night Moves Night moves  Night moves  Yeah Remember night moves Sure do remember those night moves  Ain't it funny how you remember  Funny how you remember the night moves I remember I remember I remember I remember night whoa whoa It's works Working and practicing Oh on the night moves Working and practicing
