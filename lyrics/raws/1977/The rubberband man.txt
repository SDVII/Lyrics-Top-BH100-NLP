Hand me down my walkin' cane Hand me down my hat Hurry now and don't be late 'Cause we ain't got time to chat You and me we're goin' out To catch the latest sound Guaranteed to blow your mind So high you won't come down Hey y'all prepare yourself for the rubberband man You've never heard a sound Like the rubberband man You're bound to lose control When the rubberband starts to jam Oh this dude is outta sight Everything he does Seems to come out right Once I went to hear him play At a club outside of town I was so surprised I was hypnotized By the sound these cats put down When I saw this short fat guy Stretch a band between his toes Hey I laughed so hard 'Cause the man got down When it finally reached his nose Hey y'all prepare yourself for the rubberband man You've never heard a sound Like the rubberband man You're bound to lose control When the rubberband starts to jam Got that rubber band Up on his toes And then he wriggled it up All around his nose Guaranteed to blow your mind Playin' all that music yet keepin' time Where in the world did he learn that oh Lord Lord help him get away Hey y'all prepare yourself for the rubberband man You've never heard a sound Like the rubberband man You're bound to lose control When the rubberband starts to jam Rubberband man rubberband man How much of this stuff do he think we can stand  So much rhythm grace and debonair for one man Lord And then he had the nerve to twiggle his left toe Slip it through his knee got the feeling in his head y'all Aw come on baby Hey y'all prepare yourself for the rubberband man You've never heard a sound Like the rubberband man You're bound to lose control When the rubberband starts to jam Rubberband man starts to jam Moving up and down cross the land Got the people all in his wake Everything probably seems outta place Just move it just move it Just move move move it Just rubberband rubberband man Just move it just move it Just move move move it Just rubberband rubberband man Get down Oh get down low Ah ha
