Once in every life     someone comes along And you came to me     it was almost like a song You were in my heart     right where you belong And we were so in love     it was almost like a song January through December     we had such a perfect year Then the flames became a dying ember     All at once you weren't here Now my broken heart     cries for you each night And it's almost like a song     but it's much too sad to write Now my broken heart     cries for you each night And it's almost like a song     but it's much to sad to write     Much too sad to write
