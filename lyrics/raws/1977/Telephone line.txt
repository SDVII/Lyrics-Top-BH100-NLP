Hello  How are you  Have you been alright through all those lonely nights  That's what I'd say I'd tell you everything If you'd pick up that telephone Hey  How you feeling  Are you still the same  Don't you realize the things we did we did Were all for real not a dream  I just can't believe They've all faded out of view Doo wop do be do do wop Doo wa doo day Blue days black nights Doo wa doo day I look into the sky And I wonder why Telephone line give me some time I'm living in twilight Telephone line give me some time I'm living in twilight Ok so no one's answering Well can't you just let it ring a little longer  I'll just sit tight through shadows of the night Let it ring for evermore
