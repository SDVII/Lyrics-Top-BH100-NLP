Backstroking lover Always hiding 'neath the covers 'Till I talked to my daddy he say He said  You ain't seen nothing 'Til you're down on a muffin Then you're sure to be a changing your ways   I met a cheerleader Was a real young bleeder All the times I could reminisce Cause the best things of loving With her sister and her cousin Only started with a little kiss Like this See saw swinging with the boys in the school With your feet flying up in the air Singing hey diddle diddle With your kitty in the middle Of the swing like I didn't care So I took a big chance At the high school dance With a missy who was ready to play Wasn't me she was fooling Cause she knew what she was doing And I knew love was here to stay When she told me to  Walk this way talk this way   Walk this way walk this way   Walk this way walk this way   Walk this way talk this way  Ah just give me a kiss Like this School girl sweetie With the classy kinda sassy Little skirt's climbing way up her knee There was three young ladies In the school gym locker When I noticed they was looking at me I was a high school loser Never made it with a lady Till the boys told me something I missed Then my next door neighbor With a daughter had a favor So I gave her just a little kiss Like this See saw swinging with the boys in the school With your feet flying up in the air Singing hey diddle diddle With your kitty in the middle Of the swing like I didn't care So I took a big chance At the high school dance With a missy who was ready to play Wasn't me she was fooling Cause she knew what she was doing When she taught me how to walk this way She told me to  Walk this way talk this way   Walk this way walk this way   Walk this way walk this way   Walk this way talk this way  Just give me a kiss Like this
