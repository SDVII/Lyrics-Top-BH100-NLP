Hello my love I heard a kiss from you Red magic satin playing near too All through the morning rain I gaze the sun doesn't shine Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind In the garden I see west purple shower bells and tea Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green Pretty music I hear so happy and loud Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue Playgrounds will laugh If you try to ask or is it cool is it cool  If you arrive and don't see me I'm gonna be with my baby I'm free flying in her arms Over the sea Stained window yellow candy screen See speakers of kites With velvet roses diggin' freedom flight A present from you Strawberry letter 22 The music plays I sit in for a few A present from you Strawberry letter 22 The music plays I sit in for a few A present from you Strawberry letter 22 The music plays I sit in for a few
