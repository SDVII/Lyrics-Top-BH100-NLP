Tommy Mottola lives on the road He lost his lady just four months ago Maybe he'll find her Maybe he won't Oh no never no no He sleeps in the back of his grey cadillac Oh my honey Blowing his mind on cheap grass and wine Oh ain't it crazy baby yeah Guess you could say Hey hey This man has learnt his lesson Oh oh hey hey Now he's alone He's got no women and no home For misery oh  ho Cherchez la femme Miggie Miggie Bonija's very upset She's sick and tired of livin' in debt Tired of roaches Tired of rats I know she is So her noble man says  Baby I understand  oh my honey Now he's working two jobs at Eighth Avenue bars Oh ain't it crazy Now she complains That her man is never present So she goes next door I know she's just playing the whore For misery Cherchez la femme They'll tell you a lie with a colgate smile Hey baby Love you one second and hate you the next Oh ain't it crazy yeah All I can say Of one thing I am certain Theyr'e all the same All the sluts and the saints For misery Cherchez la femme
