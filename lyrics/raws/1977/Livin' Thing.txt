Sailin' away on the crest of a wave It's like magic Oh rollin' and ridin' and slippin'   slidin' It's magic And you and your sweet desire You took me oh higher and higher baby It's a livin' thing It's a terrible thing to lose It's a given thing What a terrible thing to lose Making believe this is what you conceived From your worst day  Oh moving in line then you look back in time To the first day  And you and your sweet desire  You took me oh higher and higher baby It's a livin' thing It's a terrible thing to lose It's a given thing What a terrible thing to lose Takin' a dive 'cause you can't halt the slide Floating downstream  Oh so let her go don't start spoiling the show It's a bad dream  And you and your sweet desire  You took me oh higher and higher baby It's a livin' thing It's a terrible thing to lose It's a given thing What a terrible thing to lose It's a livin' thing It's a terrible thing to lose It's a given thing What a terrible thing to lose
