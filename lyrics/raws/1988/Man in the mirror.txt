I'm gonna make a change For once in my life Gonna feel real good Gonna make a difference Gonna make it right As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat This wind is blowin' my mind See the kids in the street with not enough to eat Who am I to be blind pretending not to see their needs A summer's disregard a broken bottle top And one man's soul They follow each other on the wind ya know 'Cause they got nowhere to go That's why I want you to know I'm starting with the man in the mirror I'm asking him to change his ways And no message could have been any clearer If you wanna make the world a better place Take a look at yourself and then make a change I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love It's time that I realize There are some with no home Not a nickel to loan Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone A willow deeply scarred somebody's broken heart And a washed out dream They follow the pattern of the wind ya see 'Cause they got no place to be That's why I'm starting with me I'm starting with the man in the mirror I'm asking him to change his ways And no message could have been any clearer If you wanna make the world a better place Take a look at yourself and then make a change I'm starting with the man in the mirror I'm asking him to change his ways And no message could have been any clearer If you wanna make the world a better place Take a look at yourself and then make that change I'm starting with the man in the mirror  I'm asking him to change his ways  And no message could have been any clearer If you wanna make the world a better place Take a look at yourself and then make the change You gotta get it right while you got the time 'Cause when you close your heart  Then you close your mind   I'm starting with the man in the mirror  I'm asking him to change his ways And no message could have been any clearer If you want to make the world a better place Take a look at yourself and then make that Change  Make that change
