I see me with you and all the things you do Keep turning round and round in my mind Forget the weather we should always be together And any other thought is unkind To have you with me I would swim the sevens seas To have you as my guide and my light My love is a flame that burns in your name We'll be together We'll be together tonight We'll be together yeah Call me baby  You can call me anything you want Call me baby Call me Just call me I see you with me and baby makes three I see me with you and all the things we do Forget the weather we should always be together I need you as my guide and my light My love is a flame that burns in your name We'll be together We'll be together tonight
