So wild standing there with her hands in her hair I can't help remember just where she touched me There's still no face here in her place So cool she was like jazz on a summer's day Music high and sweet then she just blew away Now she can't be that warm with the wind in her arms Valerie call on me call on me Valerie Come and see me I'm the same boy I used to be Love songs fill the night but they don't tell it all Not how lovers cry out just like they're dying Her cries hang there in time somewhere Someday some good wind may blow her back to me Some night I may hear her like she used to be No it can't be that warm with the wind in her arms Someday some good wind may blow her back to me Some night I may hear her like she used to be No it can't be that warm with the wind in her arms
