Time time time see what s become of me While I looked around for my possibilities I was so hard to please Don t look around The leaves are brown And the sky is a hazy shade of winter Hear the Salvation Army band Down by the riverside s there s bound to be a better ride Than what you ve got planned Carry your cup in your hand And look around Leaves are brown now And the sky is a hazy shade of winter Hang on to your hopes my friend That s an easy thing to say But if your hopes should pass away Simply pretend that you can build them again Look around The grass is high The fields are ripe It s the springtime of my life Seasons change with the scenery Weaving time in a tapestry Won t you stop and remember me At any convenient time Funny how my memory skips while looking over manuscripts Of unpublished rhyme Drinking my vodka and lime I look around Leaves are brown now And the sky is a hazy shade of winter Look around Leaves are brown There s a patch of snow on the ground Look around Leaves are brown There s a patch of snow on the ground Look around Leaves are brown There s a patch of snow on the ground
