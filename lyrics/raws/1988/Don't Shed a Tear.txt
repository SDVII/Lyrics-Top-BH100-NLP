Cab fare to nowhere is what you are A white line to an exit sign is what you are Oh but I saw in you now I see through CHORUS  Don't shed a tear for me My life won't end without you Long as the night will be The sun will rise without you A locked door on a candy store is what you are A slim chance in tight pants is what you are All that I loved you for I want it more CHORUS You are giving what I'm not taking I'm not missing what we ain't making Oh but I saw in you now I see through CHORUS CHORUS Don't shed no tears I don't need a thing
