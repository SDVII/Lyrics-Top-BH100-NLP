If a boy had a chance A chance with someone like you Are you gonna break his heart Let him cry for the moon Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes  I just freeze every time You see through me And it's all over you Electric blue On my knees Help me baby Tell me what can I do  Electric blue Oh I had a dream For a moment I believed it was true Oh I'd have given anything Just to be there with you Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes  I just freeze every time You see through me And it's all over you Electric blue In too deep Standing here waiting As I'm breaking in two Electric blue I can see Can see that it may be Just a vision of you Electric blue On my knees Help me baby Tell me what can I do  Electric blue Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes  I just freeze Every time you see through me And it's all over you Electric blue In too deep Standing here waiting As I'm breaking in two Electric blue I can see Can see that it may be Just a vision of you Electric blue On my knees Help me baby Tell me what can I do  Electric blue I just freeze Every time you see through me And it's all over you Electric blue In too deep Standing here waiting As I'm breaking in two Electric blue  I can see Can see that it May be just a vision of you Electric blue On my knees Help me baby Tell me what can I do  Electric blue Electric blue Electric blue Electric blue
