I don't love her I tried to tell myself But you can see it in my eyes So don't deny I can't fool no one else The truth is in the tears I cry 'Cause    If it isn't love Why do I feel this way Why does she stay on my mind If it isn't love Why does it hurt so bad Make me feel so sad inside If it isn't love I told her I'd never fall in love But now I know better How does it feel I can't describe this feeling That came when I saw her last night She got to me I'll let you know the reason I saw her with another guy So    If it isn't love Why do I feel this way Why does she stay on my mind And if it isn't love Why does it hurt so bad Make me feel so sad inside If it isn't love   Maybe she'll take me back I made a big mistake Now I can feel it I really love her It took my heart To shatter in a thousand pieces Before I'd ever drop my pride Losing love worrying about my image Really helped me realize   If it isn't love Why do I feel this way Why does she stay on my mind If it isn't love Why does it hurt so bad Make me feel so sad inside If it isn't love If it isn't love Why do I feel this way Why does she stay on my mind If it isn't love Why does it hurt so bad Make me feel so sad inside If it isn't love Why do I feel this way Why does she stay on my mind If it isn't love Why does it hurt so bad Make me feel so sad inside If it isn't love Why do I feel this way Why does she stay on my mind If it isn't love Why does it hurt so bad Make me feel so sad inside If it isn't love If it isn't love
