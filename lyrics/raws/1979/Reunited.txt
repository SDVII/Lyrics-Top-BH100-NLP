I was a fool to ever leave your side Me minus you is such a lonely ride The breakup we had Has made me lonesome and sad I realize I love you cause I want you back hey hey I spent the evening with the radio Regret the moment that I let you go Our quarrel was such A way of learning so much I know now that I love you Cause I need your touch hey hey Reunited And it feels so good Reunited Cause we understood There s one perfect fit And sugar this one is it We both are so excited Cause we re reunited Hey hey I sat here staring At the same old wall Came back to life just when I got your call I wished I could climb right Through the telephone line And give you what you want So you will still be mine Hey hey I can't go cheating Honey I can't play I found it very hard to stay away As we reminisce on Precious moments like this I m glad we re back together Cause I missed your kiss Hey hey Reunited And it feels so good Reunited Cause we understood There s one perfect fit And sugar this one is it We both are so excited Cause we re reunited Hey hey Yeah yeah yeah baby Oh lover lover This is solid love And you re exactly what I m dreaming of All through the day And all through the night I ll give you all the love I have With all my might Hey hey Reunited And it feels so good Reunited Cause we understood There s one perfect fit And sugar this one is it
