Many years since I was here On the street I was passin' my time away To the left and to the right buildings towering to the sky It's outta sight in the dead of night  Here I am and in this city  With a fistful of dollars And baby you'd better believe I'm back back in the New York Groove I'm back back in the New York Groove I'm back back in the New York Groove Back in the New York Groove in the New York Groove In the back of my Cadillac A wicked lady sittin' by my side sayin'  Where are we   Stop at Third and Forty three exit to the night It's gonna be ecstacy this place was meant for me  I feel so good tonight  Who cares about tomorrow So baby you'd better believe I'm back back in the New York Groove I'm back back in the New York Groove I'm back back in the New York Groove Back in the New York Groove in the New York Groove I'm back back in the New York Groove I'm back back in the New York Groove I'm back back in the New York Groove I'm back back in the New York Groove I'm back back in the New York Groove I'm back back in the New York Groove I'm back back in the New York Groove I'm back back in the New York Groove I'm back back in the New York Groove I'm back back in the New York Groove
