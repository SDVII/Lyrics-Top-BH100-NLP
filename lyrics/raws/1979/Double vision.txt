Feeling down 'n' dirty feeling kinda mean I've been from one to another extreme This time I had a good time ain't got time to wait I wanna stick around 'till I can't see straight Fill my eyes with that double vision No disguise for that double vision Ooh when it gets through to me it's always new to me My double vision gets the best of me Never do more than I I really need My mind is racing but my body's in the lead Tonight's the night I'm gonna push it to the limit I live all of my years in a single minute Fill my eyes with that double vision No disguise for that double vision Ooh when it gets through to me it's always new to me My double vision always seems to get the best of me the best of me yeah eah eah eah hey Oh ooh  oh oh double vision  I need double vision  it takes me out of my head taking me out of my head  I get my double vision woa oah  seeing double double double vision  oh oh my my double vision  double vision yeah ah ah eah eah eah eah ah  I get double vision oooh How how
