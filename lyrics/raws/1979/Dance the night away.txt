Have you seen her  So fine and pretty  Fooled me with her style and ease And I feel her from across the room Yes it's love in the third degree Ooh baby baby Won'tcha turn your head my way  Ooh baby baby Come on take a chance You're old enough to dance the night away Oh come on baby dance the night away A live wire Barely a beginner but just watch that lady go She's on fire cause dancing gets her higher than anything else she knows Ooh baby baby Won'tcha turn your head my way  Ooh baby baby Well don't skip romance cause you're old enough to dance the night away Oh come on baby dance the night away Dance the night away Dance dance dance the night away
