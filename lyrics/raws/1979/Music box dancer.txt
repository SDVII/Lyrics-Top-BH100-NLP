You walk in the room and you're wearing a frown You reach for the shelf and cradle it down The Music Box Dancer what does it prove Only that you need to see a statue that moves A tutu of satin bordered with lace Slender lines agile legs a wonderland face Her beauty is balanced an immovable pose Eternally destined to remain on her toes Music Box Dancer she is only a toy Project upon her your dreams of wanting life's joy She's perched on her stand and never will part A final gaze upon her now the music will start You wind the doll up it's nostalgic because You've been here before so give one final pause To dream of the future to reflect on the past Music Box Dancer start your whirling at last The room fills with music such a cute song Watching her go 'round and 'round she's where she belongs Bring joy to the watchers spreading a glow Whenever wound up she'll put on a good show Music Box Dancer do you think or believe She could step off her box if she wanted to leave So easy it is twirl around with such grace Staying in her circle she remains in one place Such a brief moment a small time to spend The dancing will slow soon the music will end In real life we're plastic nature's unfair How can we breathe life how can we share The knowledge and insights hidden in tombs We're all Music Box Dancers all alone in our rooms We sit on our shelves where objects reside We don't allow the music to get right inside Music Box Dancer's now completely alone No winder or no listener because nobody's home How long before someone will re wind the spring  The room will now be witness  and silence can't sing
