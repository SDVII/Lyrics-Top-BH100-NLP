I do not care if you never come home I do not mind if you just keep on Rowing away on a distant sea Because I do not love you and you do not love me You cause a commotion when you come to town You give them a smile and they melt Having lovers and friends is all good and fine But I do not like yours and you do not like mine La la la la la la la La la la la la la la I do not care what you do at night Oh and I don't care how you get your delights I am going to leave you alone I will just let it be I do not love you and you do not love me I got a problem  Can you relate  I got a woman calling love hate We made a vow we would always be friends How could we know that promises end  I tried to love you for years upon years You refuse to take me for real It is time you saw what I want you to see And I would still love you if you would just love me La la la la la la la La la la la la la la
