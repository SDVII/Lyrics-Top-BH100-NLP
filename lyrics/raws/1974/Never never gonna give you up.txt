Spoken  Oh baby you know I've waited waited so long To sing   to sing this song Whatever whatever babe I'll do it Forever and ever yeah  yeah yeah yeah I'll see you through it I've got to keep you pleased in every way I can Gonna give you all of me as much or you can stand Make love to you right now that's all I want to do I know you need it boy and you know I need it too cause I've found what the world is searchin' for Here right here my dear I don't have to look no more And all of my days I hoped and I prayed For someone just like you to makes me feel the way you do Chorus  Never Never gonna give you up I'm never ever gonna stop Not the way I feel about you babe I just can't live without you I'm never ever gonna quit 'cause quiting just ain't my schtick I'm gonna lay right here with you and do all the Things you want me to Whatever you want boy you got it And whatever you need I don't want to see you without it You've given me much more than words could ever say Oh my dear I'II be right here until my dying day I don't know just how to say all the things I feel I just know that I love you so and it gives me Such a thrill 'cause I've found what the world is lookin' for Here right here my dear I don't have to search no more And all of my days I hoped and I prayed For someone just like you to makes me feel the way you do Chorus x 2
