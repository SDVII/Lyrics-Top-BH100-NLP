Ever since I met you Seems I can't forget you The thought of you keeps Running through the back of my mind Every time I'm near you I get that urge to feel you Just touching you And loving you makes everything right I never knew love before Then came you you Then came you I never knew love before Then came you Then came you You Now that I have found you How did I live without you It's plain to see You're all I need to satisfy me I'm so darned proud of you I wanna sing about you All I know You made love grow By touching my hand Oh uh oh I never knew love before Then came you  Then came you ooh I never knew love before Then came you  Then came you Hey hey hey Then came you Whoa oh uh oh oh oh I never knew love before Then came you Then came you I never knew love before Then came you  Then came you Whoa oh uh oh oh oh I never knew love before Then came you  Then came you you I never knew love before  Then came you  you Ooh ooh Then came  Oh uh no I never knew love before Then came you
