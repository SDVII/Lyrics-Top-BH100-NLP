 i cant light no more of your darkness all my pictures seem to fade to black and white im growing tired and time stands still before me frozen here on the ladder of my life meaning byamandah editor on february 27th 2016 elton john performed a free concert on las sunset strip as a thankyou to his aids foundation supporters he welcomed close friend see all too late to save myself from falling i took a chance and changed your way of life but you misread my meaning when i met you closed the door and left me blinded by the lightdont let the sun go down on me although i searched myself its always someone else i see id just allow a fragment of your life to wander free but losing everything is like the sun going down on mei cant find the right romantic line but see me once and see the way i feel dont discard me just because you think i mean you harm but these cuts i have they need love to help them heal
