You come on like a dream peaches and cream Lips like strawberry wine You're sixteen you're beautiful and you're mine You're all ribbons and curls ooh what a girl Eyes that sparkle and shine You're sixteen you're beautiful and you're mine You're my baby you're my pet We fell in love on the night we met You touched my hand my heart went pop Ooh when we kissed I could not stop You walked out of my dreams and into my arms Now you're my angel divine You're sixteen you're beautiful and you're mine You're my baby you're my pet We fell in love on the night we met You touched my hand my heart went pop Ooh when we kissed I could not stop You walked out of my dreams and into my car Now you're my angel divine You're sixteen you're beautiful and you're mine You're sixteen you're beautiful and you're mine You're sixteen so beautiful and you're mine All mine all mine all mine All mine all mine all mine
