Everybody's doin' a brand new dance now I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now My little baby sister can do it with ease It's easier than learnin' your ABCs So come on come on and do the Loco Motion with me You've got to swing your hips now Come on Jump up Jump back Oh well I think you've got the knack Woah woah Now that you can do it well let's make a chain now A chuga chuga motion like a railroad train now Do it nice and easy now and don't lose control A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul So come on come on and do the Loco Motion with me Woah woah Move around the floor in a loco motion Do it holdin' hands if'n you get the notion There's never been a dance that's so easy to do It even makes you happy when you're feelin' blue So come on come on and do the Loco Motion with me So come on come on and do the Loco Motion with me So come on come on and do the Loco Motion with me
