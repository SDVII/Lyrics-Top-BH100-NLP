 It s getting so lonely inside this bed Don t know if I should lick my wounds or say woe is me instead And there s an aching inside my head It s telling me You re better off alone But after midnight morning will come And the day will see if you will get some They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough Well it s till I turn off the light turn off the light They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough Well it s til I turn off the light turn off the light And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down Til you see all my dreams Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems I looked above the other day Cause I think I m good and ready for a change I live my life by the moon If it s high play it low if it s harvest go slow and if it s full then go But after midnight morning will come And the day will see if you will get some They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough Well it s til I turn off the light turn off the light They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough Well it s til I turn off the light turn off the light And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down Til you see all my dreams Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems I m searching for things that I just cannot see Why don t you don t you don t you come and be with me I pretend to be cool with me wanna believe That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve I m running I m running catch up with me life Where is the love that I m looking to find It s all in me can t you see why can t you why can t you see it s all in me All in me yeah where is your logic Who do you need And I said follow me follow me follow me Down down down down Do you see all my dreams Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems Follow me follow me Down down down down Follow me down follow me Down down down And I said follow me follow me follow me Down down down down See all my dreams Follow me follow me follow me Down down down down See all my dreams See all my dreams All in me yeah where is your logic Who do you need Where can you turn Who do you need
