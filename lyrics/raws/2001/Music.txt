 Uh huh aiyyo yo uh huh yeah yeah uh uh uh There s no doubt no doubt no doubt uh Worrdd up To relax my mind so I can be free And ab sorb sound that keep me round Doin my thang constantly with no worries Peace to Keith Murray To keep me flowin and keep me goin And keep me growin and keep me the E from knowin What happens out there is not my concern You wanna die it s not my turn To do somethin to me like jump in the Mercedes On the highway doin over eighty Without music baby Make me call my homey on the phone Like there s somethin new out that got me in the zone Just that feelin got me I wish music can adopt me Turn on some music I got my music Turn on some music I got my music Turn on some music I got my music Turn on some music I got my music just like music Put me in the mood with my woman Got me in the ear sayin sweet nothings Make love come out the mouth no frontin Like all of a sudden Takin away your worries and cares Any problems music ll be right there Together match yo we a perfect pair Is that true Marvin Yo to get you to bang this Body soul snatcher universal language It be the light so open up This is it what the fuck One fly tune That have black and white vibe in one room No confrontation parlay all night It s just the sensation Music is the soul of the man Music makes a happy day Music makes a cloud flow by baby Your music is my tears in side my eyes Your music makes me want to sing Girl music is a joy to bring Music is my heart and soul more precious than gold Happiness for days justice all the way I love your music baby Repeats and fades Hey doo doo doo doo doo Turn on some music turn on some music Just like music doo doo doo doo doo
