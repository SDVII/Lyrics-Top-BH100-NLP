Got a girl from the south side got braids in her hair First time I seen her walk by man I 'bout fell up out my chair Had to get her number it took me like six weeks Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats Body like a back road drivin' with my eyes closed I know every curve like the back of my hand Doin' 15 in a 30 I ain't in no hurry I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can The way she fit in them blue jeans she don't need no belt But I can turn them inside out I don't need no help Got hips like honey so thick and so sweet man It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets Body like a back road drivin' with my eyes closed I know every curve like the back of my hand Doin' 15 in a 30 I ain't in no hurry I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can We're out here in the boondocks With the breeze and the birds Tangled up in the tall grass With my lips on hers On a highway to heaven Headed south of her smile mmm Get there when we get there Every inch is a mile Body like a back road drivin' with my eyes closed I know every curve like the back of my hand Doin' 15 in a 30 I ain't in no hurry I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can I'ma take it slow Just as fast as I can Body like a back road Drivin' with my eyes closed I know every curve like the back of my hand Got braids in her hair
