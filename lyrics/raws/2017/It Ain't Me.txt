I had a dream We were sipping whiskey neat Highest floor The Bowery Nowhere's high enough Somewhere along the lines We stopped seeing eye to eye You were staying out all night And I had enough No I don't wanna know Where you been or where you're goin' But I know I won't be home And you'll be on your own Who's gonna walk you Through the dark side of the morning  Who's gonna rock you When the sun won't let you sleep  Who's waking up to drive you home When you're drunk and all alone  Who's gonna walk you Through the dark side of the morning  It ain't me The Bowery whiskey neat grateful I'm so grateful It ain't me The Bowery whiskey neat grateful I'm so grateful It ain't me The Bowery whiskey neat grateful I'm so grateful It ain't me The Bowery whiskey neat grateful I'm so grateful It ain't me I had a dream We were back to seventeen Summer nights and The Libertines Never growing up I'll take with me The polaroids and the memories But you know I'm gonna leave Behind the worst of us Who's gonna walk you Through the dark side of the morning  Who's gonna rock you When the sun won't let you sleep  Who's waking up to drive you home When you're drunk and all alone  Who's gonna walk you Through the dark side of the morning  It ain't me no no It ain't me no no It ain't me no no It ain't me no no Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning  It ain't me The Bowery whiskey neat grateful I'm so grateful It ain't me The Bowery whiskey neat grateful I'm so grateful It ain't me The Bowery whiskey neat grateful I'm so grateful
