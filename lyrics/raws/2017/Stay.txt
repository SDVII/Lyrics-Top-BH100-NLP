Waiting for the time to pass you by Hope the winds of change will change your mind I could give a thousand reasons why And I know you and you've got to Make it on your own but we don't have to grow up We can stay forever young Living on my sofa drinking rum and cola Underneath the rising sun I could give a thousand reasons why But you're going and you know that All you have to do is stay a minute Just take your time The clock is ticking so stay All you have to do is wait a second Your hands on mine The clock is ticking so stay All you have to do is All you have to do is stay Won't admit what I already know I've never been the best at letting go I don't wanna spend the night alone Guess I need you and I need to Make it on my own but I don't wanna grow up We can stay forever young Living on my sofa drinking rum and cola Underneath the rising sun I could give a million reasons why But I'm going and you know that All you have to do is stay a minute Just take your time The clock is ticking so stay All you have to do is wait a second Your hands on mine The clock is ticking so stay All you have to do is All you have to do is stay All you have to do is stay So stay yeah All you have to do is stay a minute Just take your time The clock is ticking so stay All you have to do is wait a second Your hands on mine The clock is ticking so stay All you have to do is stay
