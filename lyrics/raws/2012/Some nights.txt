 Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck Some nights I call it a draw Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle Some nights I wish they d just fall off But I still wake up I still see your ghost Oh Lord I m still not sure what I stand for oh What do I stand for What do I stand for Most nights I don t know anymore This is it boys this is war What are we waiting for Why don t we break the rules already I was never one to believe the hype Save that for the black and white Try twice as hard and I m half as liked But here they come again to jack my style And that s alright I found a martyr in my bed tonight She stops my bones from wondering Just who I who I who I am Oh who am I Well some nights I wish that this all would end Cause I could use some friends for a change And some nights I m scared you ll forget me again Some nights I always win But I still wake up I still see your ghost Oh Lord I m still not sure what I stand for oh What do I stand for What do I stand for Most nights I don t know So this is it I sold my soul for this Washed my hands of that for this I miss my mom and dad for this No When I see stars when I see stars that s all they are When I hear songs they sound like a swan So come on Oh come on Oh come on Oh come on Well that is it guys that is all Five minutes in and I m bored again Ten years of this I m not sure if anybody understands This one is not for the folks back home Sorry to leave Mom I had to go Who the fuck wants to die alone All dried up in the desert sun My heart is breaking for my sister And the con that she called love And then I look into my nephew s eyes Man you wouldn t believe the most amazing things That can come from some terrible lie The other night you wouldn t believe The dream I just had about you and me I called you up but we d both agree It s for the best you didn t listen It s for the best we get our distance oh For the best you didn t listen It s for the best we get our distance oh
