 I m wide awake I m wide awake I m wide awake Yeah I was in the dark I was falling hard With an open heart How did I read the stars so wrong And now it s clear to me That everything you see Ain t always what it seems Yeah I was dreaming for so long I wish I knew then what I know now Wouldn t dive in wouldn t bow down Gravity hurts you made it so sweet Til I woke up on on the concrete Falling from cloud nine Crashing from the high I m letting go tonight Yeah I m falling from cloud nine I m wide awake Not losing any sleep I picked up every piece And landed on my feet Need nothing to complete myself no Yeah I am born again Out of the lion s den I don t have to pretend The story s over now the end I wish I knew then what I know now Wouldn t dive in wouldn t bow down Gravity hurts you made it so sweet Til I woke up on on the concrete Falling from cloud nine Crashing from the high I m letting go tonight I m falling from cloud nine Thunder rumbling Castles crumbling I am trying to hold on God knows that I tried Seeing the bright side But I m not blind anymore I m wide awake I m wide awake Yeah I m falling from cloud nine Crashing from the high You know I m letting go tonight I m falling from cloud nine I m wide awake I m wide awake I m wide awake I m wide awake I m wide awake
