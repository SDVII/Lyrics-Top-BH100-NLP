 My heart s a stereo It beats for you so listen close Hear my thoughts in every no Oh ote Make me your radio And turn me up when you feel low This melody was meant for you Just sing along to my stereo If I was just another dusty record on the shelf Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else If I ask you to scratch my back could you manage that Like yikky yeah check it Travie I can handle that Furthermore I apologize for any skipping tracks It s just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks I used to used to used to used to now I m over that Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artefacts If I could only find a note to make you understand I d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand Just keep it stuck inside your head like your favorite tune And know my heart s a stereo that only plays for you My heart s a stereo It beats for you so listen close Hear my thoughts in every no Oh ote Make me your radio And turn me up when you feel low This melody was meant for you Just sing along to my stereo Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Just sing along to my stereo Let s go If I was an old school fifty pound boombox Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops And crank it higher every time they told you to stop And all I ask is that you don t get mad at me When you have to purchase mad D batteries Appreciate every mixtape your friends make You never know we come and go like on the interstate I think I finally found a note to make you understand If you could hit it sing along and take me by the hand Just keep it stuck inside your head like your favorite tune You know my heart s a stereo that only plays for you My heart s a stereo It beats for you so listen close Hear my thoughts in every no Oh ote Make me your radio And turn me up when you feel low This melody was meant for you Just sing along to my stereo Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Just sing along to my stereo I only pray you never leave me behind Because good music can be so hard to find I take your hand and hold it closer to mine Thought love was dead but now you re changing my mind My heart s a stereo It beats for you so listen close Hear my thoughts in every no Oh ote Make me your radio And turn me up when you feel low This melody was meant for you Just sing along to my stereo Oh oh oh oh oh Yeah yeah ye eh eh Oh oh oh oh Yeah yeah ye eh eh Oh oh oh Yeah yeah ye eh eh Just sing along to my stereo Yeah yeah yeah Yeah
