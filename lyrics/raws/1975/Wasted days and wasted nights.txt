Wasted days and wasted nights I have left for you behind For you don't belong to me Your heart belongs To someone else Why should I keep loving you When I know that you're not true And why should I call your name When you're the blame For making me blue  Don't you remember the day That you went away And left me I was so lonely Prayed for you only My love Why should I keep loving you When I know that you're not true And why should I call you're name When you're the blame For making me blue Don't you remember the day That you went away And left me I was so lonely Prayed for you only My love Why should I keep loving you When I know that you're not true  And why should I call your name When you're the blame For making me blue
