The time is right You hold me tight And love's got me high Please tell me yes And don't say no honey Not tonight I need to have you next to me In more ways than one And I refuse to leave 'till I see the Morning sun creep through your window pane Cause love won't let me wait The time is right Turned down the lights And take my hand We will take a flight And spend the night In a wonderland Now move a little close to me You owe it to yourself And I will selfishly take a little for myself And it's because of you That love won't let me wait I need your love so desperately And only you can set me free When I make love to you We will explode in ecstacy And I won't take the blame Cause love won't let me wait no Love won't let me wait  Love won't let me wait  Love won't let me wait
