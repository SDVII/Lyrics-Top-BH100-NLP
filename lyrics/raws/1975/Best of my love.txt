Every night I'm lying in bed Holding you close in my dreams Thinking about all the things that we said And coming apart at the seams We try to talk it over But the words come out too rough I know you were trying To give me the best of your love Beautiful faces and loud empty places Look at the way that we live Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine Left us so little to give That same old crowd Was like a cold dark cloud That we could never rise above But here in my heart I give you the best of my love Oh sweet darling you get the best of my love oh Sweet darling you get the best of my love I'm going back in time and it's a sweet dream It was a quiet night and I would be all right If I could go on sleeping But every morning I wake up and worry What's gonna happen today You see it your way And I see it mine But we both see it slipping away You know we always had each other baby I guess that wasn't enough Oh but here in my heart I give you the best of my love Oh sweet darling you get the best of my love oh Sweet darling you get the best of my love Oh sweet darling you get the best of my love oh Sweet darling you get the best of my love Oh sweet darling you get the best of my love oh Sweet darling you get the best of my love Oh sweet darling you get the best of my love oh Sweet darling you get the best of my love Oh sweet darling you get the best of my love oh Sweet darling you get the best of my love
