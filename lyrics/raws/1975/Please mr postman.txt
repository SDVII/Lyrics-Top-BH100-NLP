THAT evening James Bellingham came to see Corey after dinner and went to find him in his own room   I've come at the instance of Colonel Lapham  said the uncle   He was at my office to day and I had a long talk with him  Did you know that he was in difficulties    I fancied that he was in some sort of trouble  And I had the book keeper's conjectures  he doesn't really know much about it    Well he thinks it time  on all accounts  that you should know how he stands and why he declined that proposition of yours  I must say he has behaved very well  like a gentleman    I'm not surprised    I am  It's hard to behave like a gentleman where your interest is vitally concerned  And Lapham doesn't strike me as a man who's in the habit of acting from the best in him always    Do any of us   asked Corey   Not all of us at any rate  said Bellingham   It must have cost him something to say no to you for he's just in that state when he believes that this or that chance however small would save him   Corey was silent   Is he really in such a bad way    It's hard to tell just where he stands  I suspect that a hopeful temperament and fondness for round numbers have always caused him to set his figures beyond his actual worth  I don't say that he's been dishonest about it but he's had a loose way of estimating his assets  he's reckoned his wealth on the basis of his capital and some of his capital is borrowed  He's lost heavily by some of the recent failures and there's been a terrible shrinkage in his values  I don't mean merely in the stock of paint on hand but in a kind of competition which has become very threatening  You know about that West Virginian paint   Corey nodded   Well he tells me that they've struck a vein of natural gas out there which will enable them to make as good a paint as his own at a cost of manufacturing so low that they can undersell him everywhere  If this proves to be the case it will not only drive his paint out of the market but will reduce the value of his Works  the whole plant  at Lapham to a merely nominal figure    I see  said Corey dejectedly   I've understood that he had put a great deal of money into his Works    Yes and he estimated his mine there at a high figure  Of course it will be worth little or nothing if the West Virginia paint drives his out  Then besides Lapham has been into several things outside of his own business and like a good many other men who try outside things he's kept account of them himself  and he's all mixed up about them  He's asked me to look into his affairs with him and I've promised to do so  Whether he can be tided over his difficulties remains to be seen  I'm afraid it will take a good deal of money to do it  a great deal more than he thinks at least  He believes comparatively little would do it  I think differently  I think that anything less than a great deal would be thrown away on him  If it were merely a question of a certain sum  even a large sum  to keep him going it might be managed  but it's much more complicated  And as I say it must have been a trial to him to refuse your offer   This did not seem to be the way in which Bellingham had meant to conclude  But he said no more  and Corey made him no response  He remained pondering the case now hopefully now doubtfully and wondering whatever his mood was whether Penelope knew anything of the fact with which her mother went nearly at the same moment to acquaint her   Of course he's done it on your account  Mrs  Lapham could not help saying   Then he was very silly  Does he think I would let him give father money  And if father lost it for him does he suppose it would make it any easier for me  I think father acted twice as well  It was very silly   In repeating the censure her look was not so severe as her tone  she even smiled a little and her mother reported to her father that she acted more like herself than she had yet since Corey's offer   I think if he was to repeat his offer she would have him now  said Mrs  Lapham   Well I'll let her know if he does  said the Colonel   I guess he won't do it to you   she cried   Who else will he do it to   he demanded  They perceived that they had each been talking of a different offer  After Lapham went to his business in the morning the postman brought another letter from Irene which was full of pleasant things that were happening to her  there was a great deal about her cousin Will as she called him  At the end she had written  Tell Pen I don't want she should be foolish    There   said Mrs  Lapham   I guess it's going to come out right all round   and it seemed as if even the Colonel's difficulties were past   When your father gets through this Pen  she asked impulsively  what shall you do    What have you been telling Irene about me    Nothing much  What should you do    It would be a good deal easier to say what I should do if father didn't  said the girl   I know you think it was nice in him to make your father that offer  urged the mother   It was nice yes  but it was silly  said the girl   Most nice things are silly I suppose  she added  She went to her room and wrote a letter  It was very long and very carefully written  and when she read it over she tore it into small pieces  She wrote another one short and hurried and tore that up too  Then she went back to her mother in the family room and asked to see Irene's letter and read it over to herself   Yes she seems to be having a good time  she sighed   Mother do you think I ought to let Mr  Corey know that I know about it    Well I should think it would be a pleasure to him  said Mrs  Lapham judicially   I'm not so sure of that the way I should have to tell him  I should begin by giving him a scolding  Of course he meant well by it but can't you see that it wasn't very flattering  How did he expect it would change me    I don't believe he ever thought of that    Don't you  Why    Because you can see that he isn't one of that kind  He might want to please you without wanting to change you by what he did    Yes  He must have known that nothing would change me  at least nothing that he could do  I thought of that  I shouldn't like him to feel that I couldn't appreciate it even if I did think it was silly  Should you write to him    I don't see why not    It would be too pointed  No I shall just let it go  I wish he hadn't done it    Well he has done it    And I've tried to write to him about it  two letters  one so humble and grateful that it couldn't stand up on its edge and the other so pert and flippant  Mother I wish you could have seen those two letters  I wish I had kept them to look at if I ever got to thinking I had any sense again  They would take the conceit out of me    What's the reason he don't come here any more    Doesn't he come   asked Penelope in turn as if it were something she had not noticed particularly   You'd ought to know    Yes   She sat silent a while   If he doesn't come I suppose it's because he's offended at something I did    What did you do    Nothing  I  wrote to him  a little while ago  I suppose it was very blunt but I didn't believe he would be angry at it  But this  this that he's done shows he was angry and that he wasn't just seizing the first chance to get out of it    What have you done Pen   demanded her mother sharply   Oh I don't know  All the mischief in the world I suppose  I'll tell you  When you first told me that father was in trouble with his business I wrote to him not to come any more till I let him  I said I couldn't tell him why and he hasn't been here since  I'm sure I don't know what it means   Her mother looked at her with angry severity   Well Penelope Lapham  For a sensible child you ARE the greatest goose I ever saw  Did you think he would come here and SEE if you wouldn't let him come    He might have written  urged the girl  Her mother made that despairing  Tchk   with her tongue and fell back in her chair   I should have DESPISED him if he had written  He's acted just exactly right and you  you've acted  I don't know HOW you've acted  I'm ashamed of you  A girl that could be so sensible for her sister and always say and do just the right thing and then when it comes to herself to be such a DISGUSTING simpleton    I thought I ought to break with him at once and not let him suppose that there was any hope for him or me if father was poor  It was my one chance in this whole business to do anything heroic and I jumped at it  You mustn't think because I can laugh at it now that I wasn't in earnest mother  I WAS  dead  But the Colonel has gone to ruin so gradually that he's spoilt everything  I expected that he would be bankrupt the next day and that then HE would understand what I meant  But to have it drag along for a fortnight seems to take all the heroism out of it and leave it as flat   She looked at her mother with a smile that shone through her tears and a pathos that quivered round her jesting lips   It's easy enough to be sensible for other people  But when it comes to myself there I am  Especially when I want to do what I oughtn't so much that it seems as if doing what I didn't want to do MUST be doing what I ought  But it's been a great success one way mother  It's helped me to keep up before the Colonel  If it hadn't been for Mr  Corey's staying away and my feeling so indignant with him for having been badly treated by me I shouldn't have been worth anything at all   The tears started down her cheeks but her mother said  Well now go along and write to him  It don't matter what you say much  and don't be so very particular   Her third attempt at a letter pleased her scarcely better than the rest but she sent it though it seemed so blunt and awkward  She wrote    DEAR FRIEND  I expected when I sent you that note that you would understand almost the next day why I could not see you any more  You must know now and you must not think that if anything happened to my father I should wish you to help him  But that is no reason why I should not thank you and I do thank you for offering  It was like you I will say that  Yours sincerely PENELOPE LAPHAM  She posted her letter and he sent his reply in the evening by hand    DEAREST  What I did was nothing till you praised it  Everything I have and am is yours  Won't you send a line by the bearer to say that I may come to see you  I know how you feel  but I am sure that I can make you think differently  You must consider that I loved you without a thought of your father's circumstances and always shall  T  C  The generous words were blurred to her eyes by the tears that sprang into them  But she could only write in answer     Please do not come  I have made up my mind  As long as this trouble is hanging over us I cannot see you  And if father is unfortunate all is over between us   She brought his letter to her mother and told her what she had written in reply  Her mother was thoughtful a while before she said with a sigh  Well I hope you've begun as you can carry out Pen    Oh I shall not have to carry out at all  I shall not have to do anything  That's one comfort  the only comfort   She went away to her own room and when Mrs  Lapham told her husband of the affair he was silent at first as she had been  Then he said  I don't know as I should have wanted her to done differently  I don't know as she could  If I ever come right again she won't have anything to feel meeching about  and if I don't I don't want she should be beholden to anybody  And I guess that's the way she feels   The Coreys in their turn sat in judgment on the fact which their son felt bound to bring to their knowledge   She has behaved very well  said Mrs  Corey to whom her son had spoken   My dear  said her husband with his laugh  she has behaved TOO well  If she had studied the whole situation with the most artful eye to its mastery she could not possibly have behaved better   The process of Lapham's financial disintegration was like the course of some chronic disorder which has fastened itself upon the constitution but advances with continual reliefs with apparent amelioration and at times seems not to advance at all when it gives hope of final recovery not only to the sufferer but to the eye of science itself  There were moments when James Bellingham seeing Lapham pass this crisis and that began to fancy that he might pull through altogether  and at these moments when his adviser could not oppose anything but experience and probability to the evidence of the fact Lapham was buoyant with courage and imparted his hopefulness to his household  Our theory of disaster of sorrow of affliction borrowed from the poets and novelists is that it is incessant  but every passage in our own lives and in the lives of others so far as we have witnessed them teaches us that this is false  The house of mourning is decorously darkened to the world but within itself it is also the house of laughing  Bursts of gaiety as heartfelt as its grief relieve the gloom and the stricken survivors have their jests together in which the thought of the dead is tenderly involved and a fond sense not crazier than many others of sympathy and enjoyment beyond the silence justifies the sunnier mood before sorrow rushes back deploring and despairing and making it all up again with the conventional fitness of things  Lapham's adversity had this quality in common with bereavement  It was not always like the adversity we figure in allegory  it had its moments of being like prosperity and if upon the whole it was continual it was not incessant  Sometimes there was a week of repeated reverses when he had to keep his teeth set and to hold on hard to all his hopefulness  and then days came of negative result or slight success when he was full of his jokes at the tea table and wanted to go to the theatre or to do something to cheer Penelope up  In some miraculous way by some enormous stroke of success which should eclipse the brightest of his past prosperity he expected to do what would reconcile all difficulties not only in his own affairs but in hers too   You'll see  he said to his wife   it's going to come out all right  Irene'll fix it up with Bill's boy and then she'll be off Pen's mind  and if things go on as they've been going for the last two days I'm going to be in a position to do the favours myself and Pen can feel that SHE'S makin' a sacrifice and then I guess may be she'll do it  If things turn out as I expect now and times ever do get any better generally I can show Corey that I appreciate his offer  I can offer him the partnership myself then   Even in the other moods which came when everything had been going wrong and there seemed no way out of the net there were points of consolation to Lapham and his wife  They rejoiced that Irene was safe beyond the range of their anxieties and they had a proud satisfaction that there had been no engagement between Corey and Penelope and that it was she who had forbidden it  In the closeness of interest and sympathy in which their troubles had reunited them they confessed to each other that nothing would have been more galling to their pride than the idea that Lapham should not have been able to do everything for his daughter that the Coreys might have expected  Whatever happened now the Coreys could not have it to say that the Laphams had tried to bring any such thing about  Bellingham had lately suggested an assignment to Lapham as the best way out of his difficulties  It was evident that he had not the money to meet his liabilities at present and that he could not raise it without ruinous sacrifices that might still end in ruin after all  If he made the assignment Bellingham argued he could gain time and make terms  the state of things generally would probably improve since it could not be worse and the market which he had glutted with his paint might recover and he could start again  Lapham had not agreed with him  When his reverses first began it had seemed easy for him to give up everything to let the people he owed take all so only they would let him go out with clean hands  and he had dramatised this feeling in his talk with his wife when they spoke together of the mills on the G  L    P  But ever since then it had been growing harder and he could not consent even to seem to do it now in the proposed assignment  He had not found other men so very liberal or faithful with him  a good many of them appeared to have combined to hunt him down  a sense of enmity towards all his creditors asserted itself in him  he asked himself why they should not suffer a little too  Above all he shrank from the publicity of the assignment  It was open confession that he had been a fool in some way  he could not bear to have his family  his brother the judge especially to whom he had always appeared the soul of business wisdom  think him imprudent or stupid  He would make any sacrifice before it came to that  He determined in parting with Bellingham to make the sacrifice which he had oftenest in his mind because it was the hardest and to sell his new house  That would cause the least comment  Most people would simply think that he had got a splendid offer and with his usual luck had made a very good thing of it  others who knew a little more about him would say that he was hauling in his horns but they could not blame him  a great many other men were doing the same in those hard times  the shrewdest and safest men  it might even have a good effect  He went straight from Bellingham's office to the real estate broker in whose hands he meant to put his house for he was not the sort of man to shilly shally when he had once made up his mind  But he found it hard to get his voice up out of his throat when he said he guessed he would get the broker to sell that new house of his on the water side of Beacon  The broker answered cheerfully yes  he supposed Colonel Lapham knew it was a pretty dull time in real estate  and Lapham said yes he knew that but he should not sell at a sacrifice and he did not care to have the broker name him or describe the house definitely unless parties meant business  Again the broker said yes  and he added as a joke Lapham would appreciate that he had half a dozen houses on the water side of Beacon on the same terms  that nobody wanted to be named or to have his property described  It did in fact comfort Lapham a little to find himself in the same boat with so many others  he smiled grimly and said in his turn yes he guessed that was about the size of it with a good many people  But he had not the heart to tell his wife what he had done and he sat taciturn that whole evening without even going over his accounts and went early to bed where he lay tossing half the night before he fell asleep  He slept at last only upon the promise he made himself that he would withdraw the house from the broker's hands  but he went heavily to his own business in the morning without doing so  There was no such rush anyhow he reflected bitterly  there would be time to do that a month later probably  It struck him with a sort of dismay when a boy came with a note from a broker saying that a party who had been over the house in the fall had come to him to know whether it could be bought and was willing to pay the cost of the house up to the time he had seen it  Lapham took refuge in trying to think who the party could be  he concluded that it must have been somebody who had gone over it with the architect and he did not like that  but he was aware that this was not an answer to the broker and he wrote that he would give him an answer in the morning  Now that it had come to the point it did not seem to him that he could part with the house  So much of his hope for himself and his children had gone into it that the thought of selling it made him tremulous and sick  He could not keep about his work steadily and with his nerves shaken by want of sleep and the shock of this sudden and unexpected question he left his office early and went over to look at the house and try to bring himself to some conclusion here  The long procession of lamps on the beautiful street was flaring in the clear red of the sunset towards which it marched and Lapham with a lump in his throat stopped in front of his house and looked at their multitude  They were not merely a part of the landscape  they were a part of his pride and glory his success his triumphant life's work which was fading into failure in his helpless hands  He ground his teeth to keep down that lump but the moisture in his eyes blurred the lamps and the keen pale crimson against which it made them flicker  He turned and looked up as he had so often done at the window spaces neatly glazed for the winter with white linen and recalled the night when he had stopped with Irene before the house and she had said that she should never live there and he had tried to coax her into courage about it  There was no such facade as that on the whole street to his thinking  Through his long talks with the architect he had come to feel almost as intimately and fondly as the architect himself the satisfying simplicity of the whole design and the delicacy of its detail  It appealed to him as an exquisite bit of harmony appeals to the unlearned ear and he recognised the difference between this fine work and the obstreperous pretentiousness of the many overloaded house fronts which Seymour had made him notice for his instruction elsewhere on the Back Bay  Now in the depths of his gloom he tried to think what Italian city it was where Seymour said he had first got the notion of treating brick work in that way  He unlocked the temporary door with the key he always carried so that he could let himself in and out whenever he liked and entered the house dim and very cold with the accumulated frigidity of the whole winter in it and looking as if the arrest of work upon it had taken place a thousand years before  It smelt of the unpainted woods and the clean hard surfaces of the plaster where the experiments in decoration had left it untouched  and mingled with these odours was that of some rank pigments and metallic compositions which Seymour had used in trying to realise a certain daring novelty of finish which had not proved successful  Above all Lapham detected the peculiar odour of his own paint with which the architect had been greatly interested one day when Lapham showed it to him at the office  He had asked Lapham to let him try the Persis Brand in realising a little idea he had for the finish of Mrs  Lapham's room  If it succeeded they could tell her what it was for a surprise  Lapham glanced at the bay window in the reception room where he sat with his girls on the trestles when Corey first came by  and then he explored the whole house to the attic in the light faintly admitted through the linen sashes  The floors were strewn with shavings and chips which the carpenters had left and in the music room these had been blown into long irregular windrows by the draughts through a wide rent in the linen sash  Lapham tried to pin it up but failed and stood looking out of it over the water  The ice had left the river and the low tide lay smooth and red in the light of the sunset  The Cambridge flats showed the sad sodden yellow of meadows stripped bare after a long sleep under snow  the hills the naked trees the spires and roofs had a black outline as if they were objects in a landscape of the French school  The whim seized Lapham to test the chimney in the music room  it had been tried in the dining room below and in his girls' fireplaces above but here the hearth was still clean  He gathered some shavings and blocks together and kindled them and as the flame mounted gaily from them he pulled up a nail keg which he found there and sat down to watch it  Nothing could have been better  the chimney was a perfect success  and as Lapham glanced out of the torn linen sash he said to himself that that party whoever he was who had offered to buy his house might go to the devil  he would never sell it as long as he had a dollar  He said that he should pull through yet  and it suddenly came into his mind that if he could raise the money to buy out those West Virginia fellows he should be all right and would have the whole game in his own hand  He slapped himself on the thigh and wondered that he had never thought of that before  and then lighting a cigar with a splinter from the fire he sat down again to work the scheme out in his own mind  He did not hear the feet heavily stamping up the stairs and coming towards the room where he sat  and the policeman to whom the feet belonged had to call out to him smoking at his chimney corner with his back turned to the door  Hello  what are you doing here    What's that to you   retorted Lapham wheeling half round on his nail keg   I'll show you  said the officer advancing upon him and then stopping short as he recognised him   Why Colonel Lapham  I thought it was some tramp got in here    Have a cigar   said Lapham hospitably   Sorry there ain't another nail keg   The officer took the cigar   I'll smoke it outside  I've just come on and I can't stop  Tryin' your chimney    Yes I thought I'd see how it would draw in here  It seems to go first rate   The policeman looked about him with an eye of inspection   You want to get that linen window there mended up    Yes I'll speak to the builder about that  It can go for one night   The policeman went to the window and failed to pin the linen together where Lapham had failed before   I can't fix it   He looked round once more and saying  Well good night  went out and down the stairs  Lapham remained by the fire till he had smoked his cigar  then he rose and stamped upon the embers that still burned with his heavy boots and went home  He was very cheerful at supper  He told his wife that he guessed he had a sure thing of it now and in another twenty four hours he should tell her just how  He made Penelope go to the theatre with him and when they came out after the play the night was so fine that he said they must walk round by the new house and take a look at it in the starlight  He said he had been there before he came home and tried Seymour's chimney in the music room and it worked like a charm  As they drew near Beacon Street they were aware of unwonted stir and tumult and presently the still air transmitted a turmoil of sound through which a powerful and incessant throbbing made itself felt  The sky had reddened above them and turning the corner at the Public Garden they saw a black mass of people obstructing the perspective of the brightly lighted street and out of this mass a half dozen engines whose strong heart beats had already reached them sent up volumes of fire tinged smoke and steam from their funnels  Ladders were planted against the facade of a building from the roof of which a mass of flame burnt smoothly upward except where here and there it seemed to pull contemptuously away from the heavy streams of water which the firemen clinging like great beetles to their ladders poured in upon it  Lapham had no need to walk down through the crowd gazing and gossiping with shouts and cries and hysterical laughter before the burning house to make sure that it was his   I guess I done it Pen  was all he said  Among the people who were looking at it were a party who seemed to have run out from dinner in some neighbouring house  the ladies were fantastically wrapped up as if they had flung on the first things they could seize   Isn't it perfectly magnificent   cried a pretty girl   I wouldn't have missed it on any account  Thank you so much Mr  Symington for bringing us out    Ah I thought you'd like it  said this Mr  Symington who must have been the host   and you can enjoy it without the least compunction Miss Delano for I happen to know that the house belongs to a man who could afford to burn one up for you once a year    Oh do you think he would if I came again    I haven't the least doubt of it  We don't do things by halves in Boston    He ought to have had a coat of his noncombustible paint on it  said another gentleman of the party  Penelope pulled her father away toward the first carriage she could reach of a number that had driven up   Here father  get into this    No no  I couldn't ride  he answered heavily and he walked home in silence  He greeted his wife with  Well Persis our house is gone  And I guess I set it on fire myself   and while he rummaged among the papers in his desk still with his coat and hat on his wife got the facts as she could from Penelope  She did not reproach him  Here was a case in which his self reproach must be sufficiently sharp without any edge from her  Besides her mind was full of a terrible thought   O Silas  she faltered  they'll think you set it on fire to get the insurance   Lapham was staring at a paper which he held in his hand   I had a builder's risk on it but it expired last week  It's a dead loss    Oh thank the merciful Lord   cried his wife   Merciful   said Lapham   Well it's a queer way of showing it   He went to bed and fell into the deep sleep which sometimes follows a great moral shock  It was perhaps rather a torpor than a sleep
