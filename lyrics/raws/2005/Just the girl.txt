 She s cold and she s cruel But she knows what she s doin She pushed me in the pool At our last school reunion She laughs at my dreams But I dream about her laughter Strange as it seems She s the one I m after Cause she s bittersweet She knocks me off of my feet And I can t help myself I don t want anyone else She s a mystery She s too much for me But I keep comin back for more She s just the girl I m lookin for She can t keep a secret For more than an hour She runs on 100 proof attitude power And the more she ignores me The more I adore her What can I do I d do anything for her Cause she s bittersweet She knocks me off of my feet And I can t help myself I don t want anyone else She s a mystery She s too much for me But I keep comin back for more She s just the girl I m lookin for And when she sees it s me On her caller ID She won t pick up the phone She d rather be alone But I can t give up just yet Cause every word she s ever said Is still ringin in my head Still ringin in my head She s cold and she s cruel But she knows what she s doin Knows just what to say So my whole day is ruined Cause she s bittersweet She knocks me off of my feet And I can t help myself I don t want anyone else She s a mystery She s too much for me But I keep comin back for more She s just the girl I m lookin for Cause she s bittersweet She knocks me off of my feet And I can t help myself I don t want anyone else She s a mystery She s too much for me But I keep comin back for more Oh I keep comin back for more She s just the girl I m lookin for Just the girl I m lookin for Just the girl I m lookin for She s just the girl I m lookin for Just the girl I m lookin for Just the girl I m lookin for
