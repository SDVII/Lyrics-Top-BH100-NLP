Ever since the day you went away and left me lonely and cold My life just hasn t been the same ohh baby nooo When I looked into your eyes the moment that I let you go I just broke down Baby if I ever get the chance to be with you again I would sacrifice Cuz the feeling that I feel within No other man would ever make me feel so right Its nice to smile when I get your phone call at night But I d rather have you here with me right next to me I miss the way you hold me tight I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch I never thought that I could ever love a man so much I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny For you I d cross the world for you I d do anything Thats right baby I m going crazy I need to be your lady I ve been thinking lately That you and me yes we can make it Just ride with me roll with me I m in love with you baby Break it down now I ll tell you what I feel From the moment that I met you its been so damn real My heart seems to skip another beat Every time we speak I can t believe I feel so weak Tell me that you really need me and you want me and you miss me And you love me I m your lady I ll be around waiting for you I ll put it down be the woman for you I m falling so deep for you crazy over for you I m calling calling out to you what am I going to do It s true no fronting Its you and no other i can no longer go on without you I ll just break down I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch I never thought that I could ever love a man so much I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny For you I d cross the world for you I d do anything Thats right baby I m going crazy I need to be your lady I ve been thinking lately That you and me yes we can make it Just ride with me roll with me I m in love with you baby Ohhh ohhh Crazy lady lately Ohhh ohhh Ohh ohhh ohhhhhh Baby
