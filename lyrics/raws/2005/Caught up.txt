 I m the kind of brother Who been doing it my way getting my way for years In my career And every lover In and out my life I ve hit love and left the tears Without a care Until I met this girl who turned the tables around She caught me by surprise I never thought I d be the one breaking down I can t figure it out why I m so Got me feeling it I don t know what it is But it seems she s got me twisted I m so Got me feeling it I m losing control This girl s got a hold on me Let me go baby Now listen My mama told me Be careful who you do cause karma comes back around Same old song But I was so sure That it wouldn t happen to me cause I know how to put it down But I was so wrong This girl was mean she really turned me out Her body was so tight I m looking for her in the daytime with a flashlight My homies say this girl is cramping my style And I can t figure it out but I m so Got me feeling it I don t know what it is But it seems she s got me twisted I m so Got me feeling it I m losing control This girl s got a hold I m so Really feeling it I don t know what it is But it seems she s got me twisted I m so Really feeling it I m losing control This girl s got a hold on me This girl was mean she really turned me out My homies say this girl is cramping my style And now I m so I m feeling it I don t know what it is But it seems she s got me twisted I m so Really feeling it I m losing control This girl s got a hold I m so I m so I don t know what it is But it seems she s got me twisted I m Really feeling it I m losing control This girl s got a hold on me
