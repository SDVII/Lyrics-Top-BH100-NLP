Summer lovin' had me a blast Summer lovin' happened so fast I met a girl crazy for me Met a boy cute as can be Summer days drifting away To uh oh those summer nights Well a well a well a uh  Tell me more tell me more Did you get very far  Tell me more tell me more Like does he have a car  She swam by me she got a cramp He ran by me got my suit damp I saved her life she nearly drowned He showed off splashing around Summer sun something's begun But uh oh those summer nights Well a well a well a uh  Tell me more tell me more Was it love at first sight  Tell me more tell me more Did she put up a fight  Took her bowling in the arcade We went strolling drank lemonade We made out under the dock We stayed out till ten o'clock Summer fling don't mean a thing But uh oh those summer nights Woah woah woah Tell me more tell me more But you don't gotta brag Tell me more tell me more Cause he sounds like a drag Shooda bop bop Shooda bop bop Shooda bop bop Shooda bop bop Shooda bop bop Shooda bop bop Shooda bop bop Yeah He got friendly holding my hand Well she got friendly down in the sand He was sweet just turned eighteen Well she was good you know what I mean Summer heat boy and girl meet But uh oh those summer nights Woah woah woah Tell me more tell me more How much dough did he spend  Tell me more tell me more Could she get me a friend  It turned colder that's where it ends So I told her we'd still be friends Then we made our true love vow Wonder what she's doin' now   Summer dreams ripped at the seams But oh those summer nights
