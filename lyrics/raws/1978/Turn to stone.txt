The city streets are empty now And so the songs are way down low A sound that flows into my mind Of everything that is alive I turn to stone When you are gone I turn to stone Turn to stone When you comin' home  I can't go on The dying embers of the night Still glow upon the wall so bright The tired streets that hide away Roll past my door into the day In my blue world I turn to stone When you are gone I turn to stone Turn to stone When you comin' home  I can't go on Turn to stone When you are gone I turn to stone The dancing shadows on the wall Are all I've seen since you've been gone Through all I sit here and I wait You will return again someday To my blue world I turn to stone When you are gone I turn to stone Turn to stone When you comin' home  I can't go on Turn to stone When you are gone I turn to stone I turn to stone When you are gone I turn to stone Turn to stone When you comin' home  I can't go on Turn to stone When You Are Gone I Turn To Stone
