Every time I move I lose When I look I'm in And every time I turn around I'm back in love I get mixed emotions It's the way my feelings flow Excuse me I'm only human Sometimes I I just don't know Every time I move I lose When I look I'm in And every time I turn around I'm back in love again Back in love again Do do do do do  Back in love When you put your arms around me I feel so satisfied I want to love you forever I just can't I can't decide Every time I move I lose When I look I'm in And every time I turn around I'm back in love again Alright  Back in love again Now it's your lover I know it's hard just to be a friend That's something else I discovered I guess I just don't ever want it to end Every time I move I lose When I look I'm in And every time I turn around I'm back in love again That I'm back in love again Alright  I'm back in love again I just don't believe it Back in love again  I can't believe it  Every time I turn around Back in love again  I get so many mixed emotions I'm back in love again  Every time I turn around Oh my love Jones coming down Back in love again  Alright alright alright Help me help me help me back in love Oh yeah back in love again I get so many mixed emotions yes I do
