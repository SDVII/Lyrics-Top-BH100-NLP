Slip slidin  away Slip slidin  away You know the nearer your destination The more you re slip slidin  away I know a man He came from my hometown He wore his passion for his woman Like a thorny crown He said  Delores I live in fear My love for you s so overpowering I m afraid that I will disappear  Slip slidin  away Slip slidin  away You know the nearer your destination The more you re slip slidin  away And I know a woman Became a wife These are the very words she uses to describe her life She said  A good day Ain t got no rain  She said  A bad day s when I lie in bed And think of things that might have been  Slip slidin  away Slip slidin  away You know the nearer your destination The more you re slip slidin  away And I know a father Who had a son He longed to tell him all the reasons For the things he d done He came a long way Just to explain He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping Then he turned around and headed home again Slip slidin  away Slip slidin  away You know the nearer your destination The more you re slip slidin  away God only knows God makes his plan The information s unavailable To the mortal man We re working our jobs Collect our pay Believe we re gliding down the highway When in fact we re slip slidin  away Slip slidin  away Slip slidin  away You know the nearer your destination The more you re slip slidin  away  Outro
