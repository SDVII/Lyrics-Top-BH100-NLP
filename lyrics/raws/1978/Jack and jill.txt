Jack wanting someone to feel Sat up on the hill and Waited all day for Jill Jill always away from home Never bothering to phone Always leaving poor Jack alone Now why do you think Jack snuck down the hill He snuck down the hill 'Cause he needed love Love he couldn't get from Jill Oh yes he did Why do you think Jack snuck down the hill He snuck down the hill He needed love Oh yes he did Love he couldn't get from Jill Jack like Little Red Riding Hood Always trying to do good Waited as long as he could Jill is it right or wrong For Jack to carry on If you leave him home too long Now why do you think Jack snuck down the hill He snuck down he snuck down Broke his crown He needed love Love he couldn't get from Jill Oh sweet sweet love Why do you think Jack snuck down the hill He needed love Love he couldn't get From Jill oh yeah Now why do you think Why do you think Jack snuck down the hill Why do you think He snuck down the hill Cause he needed love He needed love Love he couldn't get from Jill Yes he did Why do you think He got down on his knees Jack snuck down the hill He had mud on his hands He needed love And he crawled and He crawled and he crawled Love he couldn't get from Jill Why do you think Jack snuck down the hill He snuck down he snuck Down from his ground He needed love He needed love Love he couldn't get from Jill He wanted sweet sweet love Why do you think Jack snuck down the hill
