Now I told you so you ought to know  It takes some time for a feeling to grow  But you're so close now I can't let you go  And I can't let go  to show the way I feel  my secrets to reveal For you are a magnet and I am steel I can't hope that I'll hold you for long  'Cause you're a woman who's lost to your song  But the love that I feel is so strong  And it can't be wrong  to show the way I feel  my secrets to reveal For you are a magnet and I am steel  to show the way I feel  my secrets to reveal For you are a magnet and I am steel For you are a magnet and I am steel For you are a magnet and I am steel
