There's no place for me to hide The thoughts of all the time I cried And felt this pain That I have known Because I needed just to hear That special something And then one day You just appear You said  hello   Let's make love along the way  Your name is music to my heart I'll always really love you Feel so good when I'm with you I can't believe you love me too With you it feels like it should feel With you it feels so good
