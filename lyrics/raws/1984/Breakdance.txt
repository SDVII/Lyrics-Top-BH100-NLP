There was this new feeling coming out of the streets Everybody's talkin' 'bout it wherever they meet Down by the corner keep getting the heat Then my feet start moving to the rhythmic beat Breakdancin' Break out Breakdancin' Break out They used to do The Locomotion do The Jerk and The Twist But there just ain't never been nothin' like this Now poppin' and lockin' is the new way of talkin' There's a work at the shop spinnin' out on the floor Hearts are pumpin' beat is thumpin' Love the way you're lookin' tonight Fevers risin' no surprisin' We won't have the time to fight
