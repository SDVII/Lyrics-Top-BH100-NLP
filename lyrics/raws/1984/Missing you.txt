Missing you Missing you Missing you Missing you Missing you Missing you Missing you Missing you Every time I think of you I always catch my breath And I'm still standing here And you're miles away And I'm wondering why you left In your world I have no meaning Though I'm trying hard to understand   But I ain't missing you at all Since you've been gone away I ain't missing you No matter what my friends say Ain't missing you Since you've been gone away I ain't missing you No matter what my friends say
