Hot summer streets And the pavements are burning I sit around Trying to smile But the air is so heavy and dry Strange voices are saying Things I can't understand It's too close for comfort This heat has got right out of hand It's a cruel  cruel summer Leaving me here on my own It's a cruel  cruel summer Now you're gone The city is crowded My friends are away And I'm on my own It's too hot to handle So I got to get up and go It's a cruel  cruel summer Leaving me here on my own It's a cruel  cruel summer Now you're gone You're not the only one It's a cruel  cruel summer  leaving me here on my own It's a cruel  cruel summer Now you're gone It's a cruel cruel summer Leaving me here on my own It's a cruel cruel summer Now you're gone You're not the only one It's a cruel  cruel summer  leaving me here on my own It's a cruel  cruel summer Now you're gone You're not the only one It's a cruel  cruel summer  leaving me here on my own It's a cruel  cruel summer
