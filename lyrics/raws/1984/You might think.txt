You might think I'm crazy To hang around with you Maybe you think I'm lucky To have something to do But I think that you're wild Inside me is some child You might think I'm foolish Or maybe it's untrue You might think I'm crazy But all I want is you You might think it's hysterical But I know when you're weak You think you're in the movies And everything's so deep But I think that you're wild When you flash that fragile smile You might think it's foolish What you put me through You might think I'm crazy But all I want is you And it was hard so hard to take There's no escape without a scrape But you kept it going till the sun fell down You kept it going Well you might think I'm delirious The way I run you down But somewhere sometimes when you're curious I'll be back around Oh I think that you're wild And so uniquely styled You might think it's foolish This chancy rendezvous You might think I'm crazy But all I want is you All I want is you All I want is you
