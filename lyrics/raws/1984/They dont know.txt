youve been around for such a long time now oh maybe i could leave you but i dont know how and why should i be lonely every night when i can be with you oh yes you make it right and i dont listen to the guys who say that youre bad for me and i should turn you away cause they dont know bout us and theyve never heard of love i get a feeling when i look at you wherever you go now i wanna be there too they say were crazy but i just dont care and if they keep on talkin still they get nowhere so i dont mind if they dont understand when i look at you when you hold my hand cause they dont know bout us and theyve never heard of love why should it matter to us if they dont approve we should just take our chances while weve got nothing to lose lose baby theres no need for living in the past now ive found good lovin gonna make it last i tell the others dont bother me cause when they look at you they dont see what i see no i dont listen to their wasted lines got my eyes wide open and i see the signs cause they dont know bout us and theyve never heard of love no i dont listen to their wasted lines got my eyes wide open and i see the signs cause they dont know bout us and theyve never heard of love
