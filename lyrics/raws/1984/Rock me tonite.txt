I'm rockin' tonite  I'm walkin' on air Gonna find me some trouble  gonna grab my share I want ya tonite  I want ya with me Make me guilty of love in the first degree    We're goin' in style Say you walk right  you talk right  and your hair's so wild   Hey that's not what I mean We go down in the shadows and crawl between Moonlight in the city brings the magic to your eyes Freezin' a moment  leave me paralyzed Breathe an emotion  set it dancin' in my ear Bring on the rhythm when I hold you near Take me in your arms  roll me through the night Take me to your heart  rock me tonite   You're passion to see You been schooled in the arts of romancin' me   You're in for a ride Can you feel the blood poundin' way down inside   No one's stoppin' us now   We go down down where the music's loud   Hey that's all right by me Go and play on my love  play it all for me Life's never easy  we can make it if we try Takin' our chances  fac'em side by side Live for the moment  on that we can agree Come and take me where I long to be Take me in your arms  roll me through the night Take me to your heart  rock me tonite A time for all   and all in time A step beyond the borderline Of who we are and where we long to be    When every night you hear the sound Of wakin' up and breakin' down You find a chance and heave it all away Take me in your arms  roll me through the night Take me to your heart  rock me tonite
