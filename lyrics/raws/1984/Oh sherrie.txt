You should've been gone Knowing how I made you feel And I should've been gone After all your words of steel Oh I must have been a dreamer And I must've been someone else And we should've been over Oh Sherrie our love holds on holds on Oh Sherrie our love holds on holds on But I want to let go You'll go on hurtin' me You'd be better off alone If I'm not who you thought I'd be But you know that there's a fever That you'll never find nowhere else Can't you feel it burnin' on and on Oh Sherrie our love holds on holds on Oh Sherrie our love holds on holds on Oh Sherrie But I should've been gone Long ago far away And you should've been gone Now I know you'd lie you stay Oh Sherrie our love holds on holds on Oh Sherrie our love holds on holds on Oh Sherrie our love holds on holds on Hold on oh Sherrie
