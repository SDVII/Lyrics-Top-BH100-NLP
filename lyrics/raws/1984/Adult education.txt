Afternoon in the homeroom They're about to let you go And the locker slam On the plan you had tonight You've been messin' around with a boyfriend Maybe better left alone There's a wise guy that you know Could put you right In the lot the boy that's idling by Doesn't rev your heart Cause it's only lonely spots He shares with you And long halls and the gray walls Are gonna split apart Believe it or not There's life after high school And that's why The student body got a bad reputation What they need is adult education Back to school it's a bad situation What you want is an adult education Oh yeah The teacher don't know about how to deal With the student body  And the underclassmen are flashing Hot and cool  But your girlfriends care About watch and wear And talkin about it  Believe it or not There's life after high school  That's right The student body got a bad reputation What they need is adult education You go back to school It's a bad situation What you want is an adult education Oh yeah They're calling it preparation  You're waiting for a separation You're nothing but another odd number  Memories that you won't remember So you got a little education  And a lot of dedication But you want a little night school  Maybe some of it'll rub off on ya The boys are busy in the mirrors  Trying to imitate their heroes You make it with a false surrender  More memories you won't remember The senior with the Junior Miss  I wonder what the junior wishes That she could graduate to adult  That she could graduate to adult kisses Adult education Adult education Adult education It's a bad situation Adult education
