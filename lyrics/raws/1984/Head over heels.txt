Been running so long I've nearly lost all track of time In every direction I couldn't see the warning signs I must be losin' it 'Cuz my mind plays tricks on me It looked so easy But you know looks sometimes deceive Been running so fast Right from the starting line No more connections I don't need any more advice One hand's just reaching out And one's just hangin' on It seems my weaknesses Just keep going strong Head over heels Where should I go  Can't stop myself Outta control Head over heels No time to think Looks like The whole world's out of sync Been running so hard When what I need is to unwind The voice of reason Is one I left so far behind I've waited so long So long to play this part And just remembered That I'd forgotten about my heart Head over heels Where should I go  Can't stop myself Outta control Head over heels No time to think Looks like The whole world's out of sync Head over heels Where should I go  Can't stop myself Outta control Head over heels No time to think Looks like The whole world's out of sync Head over heels Where should I go  Can't stop myself Outta control Head over heels No time to think Looks like The whole world's out of sync Head over heels Where should I go  Can't stop myself Outta control Head over heels No time to think Looks like The whole world's out of sync
