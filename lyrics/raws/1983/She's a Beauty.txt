The regular DJ puts the music on The door in front of me opens up The guests around me are suddenly gone With their drinks and coffee cups To the beatin' tunes of Bobby Brown She s dancin' while passin' me by Right now she s the hottest babe in town Making the crowd loosen their ties She's a black beauty Directly imported from some foreign place Now she's busy doin' her duty As a stripper in a bar called Blaze From my current position I'm watching her act She's got black plastic underwear Around the dancefloor it's gettin' packed She s the reason they re here Her face  exotic with a constant smile Her body  like sculptured in stone A nasty tattoo placed on her thigh Down here her body's not her own The business is quiet I m spending my time Tryin' to decide if it's right or wrong She stands awkwardly near me Drinkin' vodka and lime While I write the words to this song
