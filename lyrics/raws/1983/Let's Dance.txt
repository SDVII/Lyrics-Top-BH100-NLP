Ah ah ah ah Put on your red shoes and dance the blues To the song they're playing on the radio While colour lights up your face Sway through the crowd to an empty space If you say run I'll run with you And if you say hide we'll hide Because my love for you Would break my heart in two If you should fall into my arms And tremble like a flower For fear your grace should fall For fear tonight is all You could look into my eyes Under the moonlight this serious moonlight And if you say run I'll run with you And if you say hide we'll hide Because my love for you Would break my heart in two If you should fall into my arms And tremble like a flower Put on your red shoes and dance the blues To the song we're playing Under the moonlight this serious moonlight Let's dance dance dance dance dance dance dance dance Let's dance dance dance dance dance dance dance dance
