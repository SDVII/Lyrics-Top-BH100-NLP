This generation Rules the nation With version Music happen to be the food of love Sounds to really make you rub and scrub  I say Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side It a go bun give me music make me jump and prance It a go dung give me the music make me rockin' at the dance It was a cool and lonely breezy afternoon You could feel it cause it was the month of June So I left my gate and went out for a walk As I pass the dreadlocks' camp I heard them say Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side It a go bun give me music make me jump and prance It a go dung give me the music make me rockin' at the dance So I stopped to find out what was going on Cause the spirit of Jah you know he leads you on There was a ring of dreads and a session was there in swing You could feel the chill as I seen and heard them say Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side It a go bun give me music make me jump and prance It a go dung give me the music make me rockin' at the dance Cause me say listen to the drummer me say listen to the bass Give me little music make me wind up me waist Me say listen to the drummer me say listen to the bass Give me little music make me wind up me waist I say Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side It a go bun give me music make me jump and prance It a go dung give me the music make me rockin' at the dance You play it on the radio And so me say we a go hear it on the stereo And so me know you a go play it on the disco And so me say we a go hear it on the stereo Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side It a go bun give me music make me jump and prance It a go dung give me the music make me rockin' at the dance I say east say west say north and south This is gonna really make us jump and shout
