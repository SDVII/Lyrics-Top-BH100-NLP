Until you've been beside a man You don't know what he wants You don't know if he cries at night You don't know if he don't Where nothing comes easy Old nightmares are real Until you've been beside a man You don't know how he feels Once inside a woman's heart A man must keep his head Heaven opens up the door Where angels fear to tread Some men go crazy Some men go slow Some men go just where they want Some men never go Ooooooh blame it on midnight Whooooooa shame on the moon      Instrumental Interlude      Everywhere is all around Comfort in the crowd Stanger's faces all round Laughing right out loud Hey watch where you're goin' Step light on old toes Until you've been beside a man You don't know who he knows Ooooooh blame it on midnight Whooooooa shame on the moon Ooooooh blame it on midnight Whooooooa shame on the moon Whooooa hooo hooo Blame it on midnight You can blame it on midnight Shame shame shame Shame on the moon Blame it on midnight Shame on the moon
