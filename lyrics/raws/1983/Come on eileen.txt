Come on Eileen  Come on Eileen  Poor old Johnny Ray Sounded sad upon the radio Moved a million hearts in mono Our mothers cried Sang along who'd blame them  You've grown  So grown  Now I must say more than ever Too ra loo ra too ra loo rye ay And we can sing just like our fathers Come on Eileen Oh I swear  At this moment you mean everything You in that dress My thoughts I confess Verge on dirty Oh come on Eileen These people round here Were beaten down eyes sunk in smoke dried face They're so resigned to what their fate is But not us  But not us  We are far too young and clever Too ra loo ra too ra loo rye ay And you'll hum this tune forever oh Come on Eileen Oh I swear  Aah come on let's Take off everything That pretty red dress Eileen  Aah come on let's Aah come on Eileen That pretty red dress Eileen  Aah come on let's Aah come on Eileen Please Now you're full grown Now you have shown Oh Eileen Say come on Eileen  These things they are real and I know  How you feel Now I must say more than ever Things round here have changed I say too ra loo ra too ra loo rye ay Come on Eileen Oh I swear  At this moment You mean everything You in that dress my thoughts I confess Verge on dirty Aah come on Eileen Aah come on Eileen Oh I swear  At this moment you mean everything You in that dress Oh my thoughts I confess Well they're dirty Come on Eileen Come on Eileen  What he means  You mean everything  In that dress Oh Oh believe me if all those endearing young charms That I gaze on so fondly today Were to suddenly leave you or fly in the night Just like fairy gifts gone in the sky
