Looking out across the nighttime The city winks a sleepless eye Hear her voice shake my window Sweet seducing sighs Get me out into the nighttime Four walls won't hold me tonight If this town is just an apple Then let me take a bite If they say why  why  Tell them that it's human nature Why  why  does he do me that way  If they say why  why  Tell them that it's human nature Why  why  does he do me that way  Reaching out to touch a stranger Electric eyes are everywhere See that girl she knows I'm watching She likes the way I stare If they say why  why  Tell them that it's human nature Why  why  does he do me that way  If they say why  why  Tell them that it's human nature Why  why  does he do me that way  I like livin' this way I like lovin' this way  Why  Oh why   Why  Oh why  Looking out across the morning The city's heart begins to beat Reaching out I touch her shoulder I'm dreaming of the street If they say why  why  Tell them that it's human nature Why  why  does he do me that way  If they say why  why  Ooh ooh tell 'em  Why  why  does he do me that way  If they say why  why  why  Cha da cha sha sha sha sha sha  Why  why  does he do me that way  If they say why  why  Ooh ooh tell 'em   Why  why  does he do me that way  If they say why  why  why  Ooh tell 'em  Why  why  does he do me that way  If they say why  why  Da da da da da da da da Why  why  does he do me that way  I like living this way Why  Oh why   Why  Oh why   Why  Oh why
