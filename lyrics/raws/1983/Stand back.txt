No one looked   as I walked by Just an invitation would have been just fine Said no to him   again and again First he took my heart   and then he ran No one knows how I feel What I said unless you read between my lines One man walked away from me First he took my hand   take me home Stand back   stand back In the middle of my room I did not hear from you It's alright   it's alright To be standing in a line To be standing in a line I cry    Do not turn away my friend Like a willow I can bend No man calls my name No man came So I walked on down away from you Maybe your attention was more Than you could do One man did not call He asked me for my love And that was all Stand back   stand back In the middle of my room I did not hear from you It's alright   it's alright To be standing in a line To be standing in a line I cry   So I walked on down the line Away from you Maybe your attention was more Than I could do One man   did not call Well he asked me for my love That was all Stand back    stand back In the middle of my room i did not hear from you Its alright    its alright To be standing in a line To be standing in a line I cry
