I tremble inside Just thinking About the world around us Scared can t help to wonder Bout the way we feel Do you know what I mean Say it s gonna be alright It s gonna be alright I know that we belong Do you believe in us Just give it half a chance Yes our love Will still be strong Girl I believe in us I ll give you all I can Time has redefined the meaning Love the way we know it Love the way we show it When it comes to you I like us the way it is Say it s gonna be alright It s gonna be alright I know that we belong Do you believe in us Just give it half a chance Yes our love will still be strong Girl I believe in us I ll give you all I can I don t want any changes Unless you want them to Forever ain t long enough baby Say it s gonna be alright It s gonna be alright I know that we belong Do you believe in us Just give it half a chance Yes our love will still be strong Girl I believe in us I ll give you all I can I know that we belong Do you believe in us Just give it half a chance Yes our love will still be strong Girl I believe in us I ll give you all I can I know that we belong Do you believe in us Just give it half a chance Yes our love will still be strong Girl I believe in us I ll give you all I can
