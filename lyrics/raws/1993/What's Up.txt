Twenty five years and my life is still Trying to get up that great big hill of hope For a destination I realized quickly when I knew I should That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man For whatever that means And so I cry sometimes when I m lying in bed Just to get it all out what s in my head And I I am feeling a little peculiar And so I wake in the morning and I step outside And I take a deep breath and I get real high and I Scream from the top of my lungs What s going on And I say hey yeah yeah hey yeah yeah I said hey what s going on And I say hey yeah yeah hey yeah yeah I said hey what s going on Ooh ooh ooooooooooooooooh Ooh ooh ooooooooooooooooh And I try oh my god do I try I try all the time in this institution And I pray oh my god do I pray I pray every single day For a revolution And so I cry sometimes when I m lying in bed Just to get it all out what s in my head And I I am feeling a little peculiar And so I wake in the morning and I step outside And I take a deep breath and I get real high and I Scream from the top of my lungs What s going on And I say hey yeah yeah hey yeah yeah I said hey what s going on And I say hey yeah yeah hey yeah yeah I said hey what s going on And I say hey yeah yeah hey yeah yeah I said hey what s going on And I say hey yeah yeah hey yeah yeah I said hey what s going on Ooh ooh ooooooooooooooooh ooooooooooooooooh Twenty five years I m alive here still Trying to get up that great big hill of hope For a destination Mmh mh
