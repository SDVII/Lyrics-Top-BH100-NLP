Mine immaculate dream made breath and skin I ve been waiting for you Signed with a home tattoo Happy birthday to you was created for you Oh it ll take a little time Might take a little crime To come undone now We ll try to stay blind To the hope and fear outside Hey child stay wilder than the wind And blow me into cry Who do you need who do you love When you come undone Who do you need who do you love When you come undone Words playing me deja vu Like a radio tune I swear I ve heard before Chills is it something real Or the magic I m feeding off your fingers Lost in a snow filled sky We ll make it alright To come undone now We ll try to stay blind To the hope and fear outside Hey child stay wilder than the wind And blow me into cry Who do you need who do you love When you come undone Who do you need who do you love When you come undone Who do you need who do you love When you come undone Who do you need who do you love Who do you love When you come undone
