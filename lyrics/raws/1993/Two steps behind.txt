 Walk away if you want to It s ok if you need to You can run but you can never hide From the shadow that s creeping up beside you There s a magic running through your soul But you can t have it all I ll be two steps behind you And I ll be there to remind you That it only takes a minute of your precious time To turn around and I ll be two steps behind Take the time To think about it Walk the line you know you just can t fight it Take a look around and see what you can find Like the fire that s burning up inside me There s a magic running through your soul But you can t have it all There s a magic running through your soul But you you can t have it all I ll be two steps behind you And I ll be there to remind you That it only takes a minute of your precious time To turn around and I ll be two steps behind Two steps behind Yeah baby Two steps behind Ohh sugar Two steps behind
