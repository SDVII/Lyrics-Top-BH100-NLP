 Well I m out to have a real good time And now you wanna try to fade me But friends of yours are friends of mine So don t even try to play me If you don t have nothing good to say The words you will be withholding These kinds of games a girl will play Just like mother told me so Here we go Going through the same thing Here we go Don t wanna play the same game Now this ain t the time to make a scene Because I m out with my homies I know you know just what I mean So don t just walk up on me There s a time and there s a place Where we can talk about it Cause I don t want to be disgraced With all your screams and shouting but Here we go Going through the same thing Here we go Don t wanna play the same game Climb the mountain Swim the sea See what I mean I don t know but I don t want to get too deep Ah oh ah no Ah oh ah no Ah oh ah no Ah oh Here we go again Here we go Going through the same thing Here we go Don t wanna play the same game Now there s no need to explain You know how I feel about you So don t you take my words in vain You know I can t live without you I need some time to unwind So try to be understanding I hope that you would change your mind Instead of being so demanding cause Here we go Going through the same thing Here we go Don t wanna play the same game Yo kick it Ah Ah ah Ah ah ah here we go again
