 Hold me Like the River Jordan And I will then say to thee You are my friend Carry me Like you are my brother Love me like a mother Will you be there Weary Tell me will you hold me When wrong will you scold me When lost will you find me But they told me A man should be faithful And walk when not able And fight till the end But I m only human Everyone s taking control of me Seems that the world s Got a role for me I m so confused Will you show to me You ll be there for me And care enough to bear me In our darkest hour in my deepest despair Will you still care Will you be there In my trials and my tribulations Through our doubts and frustrations In my violence in my turbulence Through my fear and my confessions In my anguish and my pain Through my joy and my sorrow In the promise of another tomorrow I ll never let you part For you re always in my heart
