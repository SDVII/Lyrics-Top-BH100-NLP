 Lately I ve had the strangest feeling oh yeah With no vivid reason here to find But yet the thought of losing you s been hanging Around my mind K Ci sing it sing it Far more frequently you re wearing perfume And with you say No special place to go But when I ask will you be coming back soon You don t know never know oh I m a man of many wishes Hope my premonition misses But what I really feel My eyes won t let me hide Cuz they always start to cry Yeah yeah baby well well Cuz this time could mean good goodbye Bye bye Farewell farewell Farewell Oh why don t you tell me Well well well Lately I ve been staring in the mirror oh yeah Very slowly picking me apart oh Saying I m trying to tell myself that I have a reason With your heart yeah yeah yeah Just the other night while you were sleeping I vaguely heard you whisper someone s name But when I asked you other thoughts your keeping You just said nothing changed I m a man of many wishes Hope my premonition misses But what I really feel My eyes won t let me hide Cuz they always start to cry Oh yes you do Cuz this time could mean good goodbye goodbye I m a man of many wishes I hope my premonition misses But what I really feel My eyes won t let me hide Cuz they always start to cry Yes they do yes they do Cuz this time could mean goodbye
