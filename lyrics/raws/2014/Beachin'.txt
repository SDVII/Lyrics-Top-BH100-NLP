 Just watching her blonde hair sun burn stare at them Whitecaps rolling over Laid back in a thrift store beach chair Dropping limes in her Corona Well she looks back yeah she throws me a kiss Like Honey I sure want you And it s a hundred and three between her and me And only 92 in Daytona And it s sunshine blue eyes tan lines so tight Rolling white sand cold can koozie in my hand just a summertime strollin Chillin breezin sippin singin woah a oh oh Beachin We got 2 for 1s we re at a margarita bar Whatever happens happens And there s a reggae band full of dread heads Just sittin in the corner laughing Well my baby walks over drops a 20 in a jar She smiles and shakes it at me Yeah she gets em going she gets em playing A little don t worry be happy And it s sunshine blue eyes tan lines so tight Rolling white sand cold can koozie in my hand just a summertime strollin Chillin breezin sippin singin woah a oh oh Beachin Talking bout Sunshine blue eyes tan lines so tight Rolling white sand cold can koozie in my hand just a summertime strollin Chillin breezin sippin singin woah a oh oh Beachin Sunshine blue eyes tan lines so tight Rolling white sand cold can koozie in my hand
