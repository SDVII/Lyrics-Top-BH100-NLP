 All summer long We ve been together And I never felt so good Cause when I m with you You re such a good time And when you get next to me You make my heartbeat fast You throw me bad when you smile And when we re alone I know we re in love Cause I can t get enough Cause You kiss me when we re playing the kissing game You keep me looking forward to another day We ve got it good We have it all it seems We re living dream yeah This is our time This wasn t meant to be Just you and me This is still new We re still young in heart And breaking too But I know our love will always be there You kiss me when we re playing the kissing game You keep me looking forward to another day baby Yeah Keep me looking forward to another day Another day Oh I like The way you make me feel baby I like the way the way you love me baby You kiss me when we re playing the kissing game You keep me looking forward to another day You kiss me when we re playing the kissing game You keep me looking forward to another day I like the way I like the way Love the way you hold me in your arms I like the way I like the way Love the way you kiss me baby I like the way I like the way I like the way I like the way I like the way I like the way I like the way I like the way I like the way we kiss I like the way I like the way Let me touch you and squeeze you I like the way I like the way That s all I gotta say
