Baby theirs something I think you should know I don t think I ll be needing you anymore It s just one of those things I m sure you ll understand We ve been together so long I never meant to do you wrong But I ve found someone new Theirs nothing you can say or do To try and change my mind Would be a waste of time Lets go our seperate ways Theirs nothing more to say Just try to ease your mind Cause I don t mean to hurt you It s just he s knows to treat me like a special lady It s time you look away He s knows just how to touch me Maybe someday you ll understand Chorus Temptation is a part of life It doesn t matter if its wrong or right Temptation is a part of life It doesn t matter if its wrong or right It makes you do what you love He s knows I can t resist Ooh his perfect lips When he looks in my eyes I feel like I ve been hypnotized I ve wanted him for so long What I felt was oh so strong Times feelings change Things were not the same Just try to ease your mind Cause I don t mean to hurt you It s just he s knows to treat me like a special lady It s time you look away He s knows just how to touch me Maybe someday you ll understand Chorus
