Artist Salt N Pepa Album Blacks Magic Song Do You Want Me You said it loud and I heard you Never tried to hurt you Some say I m old fashioned I like to take my time and do it slow You know with the flow But don t try to rush it So ride it like a horse And let nature take its course Get to know each other Be my friend not just my lover Share your thoughts with me Love my mind not just my body baby CHORUS Do you really want me baby Let me know Cuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so Got no time for silly games that ain t even why I came Cuz I may be the kind of guy you like Please understand the way I feel I must have trust or there s no deal My emotion s ain t to be Played with or given free I appreciate greatly The way you toleratered me Sometimes I do act flaky I wouldn t blame you if you hate me You put up with my butt When I wouldn t give it up Yeah I know that really sucks But if you wait awhile I ll make it up CHORUS Who me A tease Brother please You re just having bad memories About some skeeze who did the squeeze And had you on your hands and knees Look I am telling you straight out That s not what I m all about I d just be playing myself out If I spent the night at your house Now don t get me wrong I didn t mean to turn you on We haven t known each other long But this is my life not just a song CHORUS
