Across the street the river runs Down in the gutter life is slipping away Let me still exist in another place Running under cover Of a helicopter blade Flames are getting higher In effigy Burning down the bridges of my memory Love may still alive Somewhere some way Where they re downing only deer A hundred steel towns away Oh the rhythm of my heart Is beating like a drum With the words I love you Rolling off my tongue No never will I roam For I know my place is home Where the ocean meets the sky I ll be sailing Photographs and kerosene Light up my darkness Light it up Light it up I can still feel the touch Of your thin blue jeans Running down the alley I ve got my eyes all over you baby Oh baby Oh the rhythm of my heart Is beating like a drum With the words I love you Rolling off my tongue No never will I roam For I know my place is home Where the ocean meets the sky I ll be sailing Oh yeah Oh I ve got lightning in my veins Shifting like the handle Of a slot machine Love may still exist In another place I m just yanking back the handle No expression on my face Oh the rhythm of my heart Is beating like a drum With the words I love you Rolling off my tongue No never will I roam For I know my place is home Where the ocean meets the sky I ll be sailing Oh the rhythm of my heart Is beating like a drum With the words I love you Rolling off my tongue No never will I roam For I know my place is home Where the ocean meets the sky I ll be sailing The rhythm of my heart Is beating like a drum With the words I love you rolling off my tongue No never will I roam For I know my place is home Where the ocean meets the sky I ll be sailing
