In a time Where the sun descends alone I ran a long long way from home To find a heart that s made of stone I will try I just need a little time To get your face right out of my mind To see the world through different eyes Every time I see you oh I try to hide away But when we meet it seems I can t let go Every time you leave the room I feel I m fading like a flower Tell me why When I scream there s no reply When I reach out there s nothing to find When I sleep I break down and cry yeah Every time I see you oh I try to hide away But when we meet it seems I can t let go Every time you leave the room I feel I m fading like a flower Fading like a rose Fading like a rose Beaten by the storm Talking to myself getting washed by the rain It s such a cold cold town Ooh such a cold town Every time I see you oh I try to hide away But when we meet it seems I can t let go Every time you leave the room I feel I m fading like a flower Every time I see you oh I try to hide away But when we meet it seems I can t let go Every time you leave the room I feel I m fading like a Every time I see you oh I try to hide away But when we meet it seems I can t let go Every time you leave the room I feel I m fading like a flower Oooh Ooohooh I feel I m fading like a flower Oooh I m fading like a rose Every time I see you
