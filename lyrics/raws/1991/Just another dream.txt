The stars say you re my best lover Matched up like sugar for a cake They say our love could conquer anything I d always hide my feelings Keep them so cool and so contained This time it s something I just can t retain Cos you give me a good vibe don t you know baby You give me funky love funky love Could this be what love s all about baby Or is it just another dream Is this for real or is it just another dream Is this for real or is it just another dream Is this for real or is it just another dream Is this for real or is it just another dream Your voice it calls me everywhere It haunts my room most everynight This thing has sure enough got me on the line No chance for explaination It seems my heart has led the way Is this my chance to find mon amour parfait Cos you give me a good vibe don t you know baby You give me funky love funky love Could this be what love s all about baby Or is it just another dream Is this for real or is it just another dream Is this for real or is it just another dream Is this for real or is it just another dream Is this for real or is it just another dream Love can be so misleading I d cross the earth both land and sea When I feel that moment badgering me Could be it s just illusion But in feeling something good indeed Is this where loving starts to mirror my dreams Cos you give me a good vibe don t you know baby You give me funky love funky love Could this be what love s all about baby Or is it just another dream Is this for real or is it just another dream Is this for real or is it just another dream Is this for real or is it just another dream Is this for real or is it just another dream
