Ooh it must be magic How inside your eyes I see my destiny Every time we kiss I feel you breathe your love so deep inside of me If the moon and stars should fall They d be easy to replace I would lift you up to heaven And you would take their place Then I saw red When I opened up the door I saw red My heart just spilled onto the floor And I didn t need to see his face I saw yours I saw red and then I closed the door I don t think I m gonna love you anymore Everyday I wake up I thank God that you are still a part of me We ve opened up the door to which So many people never find the key And if the sun should ever fail to send its light We would burn a thousand candles And make everything alright Then I saw red When I opened up the door I saw red My heart just spilled onto the floor And I didn t need to see his face I saw yours I saw red and then I closed the door I don t think I m gonna love you anymore I ve been hurt and I ve been blind I m not sure that I ll be fine I never thought it would end this way Cause I saw red When I opened up the door I saw red My heart just spilled onto the floor And I didn t need to see his face I saw yours I saw red and then I closed the door I don t think I m gonna love you anymore Ooh it must be magic
