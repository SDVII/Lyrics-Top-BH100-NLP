Get your motor runnin' Head out on the highway Looking for adventure In whatever comes our way Yea darlin' gonna make it happen Take the world in a love embrace Fire all of your guns at once And explode into space I like smoke and lightnin' Heavy metal thunder Racing with the wind And the feeling that I'm under Yea darlin' Gonna make it happen Take the world in a love embrace Fire all of your guns at once And explode into space Like a true nature child We were born born to be wild We can climb so high I never wanna die Born to be wild Born to be wild Get your motor runnin' Head out on the highway Looking for adventure In whatever comes our way Yea darlin' gonna make it happen Take the world in a love embrace Fire all of your guns at once And explode into space Like a true nature child We were born born to be wild We can climb so high I never wanna die Born to be wild Born to be wild
