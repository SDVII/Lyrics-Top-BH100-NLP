The moment I wake up Before I put on my makeup  I say a little  And while I'm combing my hair now And wondering what dress to wear now  I say a little   Forever  yeah  Forever  ever  Together  together I run for the bus dear And while riding I think of us dear  I say a little  And at work I just take time And all through my coffee break time  I say a little   Forever  and ever  Forever  and ever  Together  together Nobody but me  Forever  ever  Forever  ever  Together  together My darling believe me  For me there is no one but you Please love me true I'm in love with you  Answer my prayer baby  Say you'll love me true  Answer my prayer baby   Forever  ever  Ever  Forever  ever  Together  together Oh nobody but me My darling believe me  For me there is no one but you Please love me true This is my prayer  Answer my prayer now baby  This is my prayer  Answer it right now baby  Say you'll love me true  This is my prayer baby  I'm in love with you
