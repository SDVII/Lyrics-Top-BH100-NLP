Cowboys to girls I remember when I used to play shoot em up Shoot em up bang bang baby I remember when I chased the girls and beat em up But I was young and didn t understand But now I m a grown up man I know girls are made for kissing Never knew what I was missing Now my life is not the same My whole world has been rearranged I went from cowboy to girls Oh yes I did Cowboys to girls I remember when I used to see you jumping rope Jumping rope up and down baby And I remember when you got your first baby coach But you were young and didn t understand Now you re a woman and I m a man And it s me that you re kissing Ain t it fun reminiscing Now our lives are not the same Our whole world has been rearranged You went from Oh yes you did And I went from cowboys to girls Oh yes I did And it s me that you re kissing Ain t it fun reminiscing And my life life is not the same This whole world has been rearranged I went from cowboys to girls Oh yes I did You went from pretty dolls to boys Oh yes I did I went from cowboys to girls
