Bottle of wine Fruit of the vine When you gonna let me get sober  Leave me alone Let me go home Let me go home and start over Ramblin' around this dirty old town Singin' for nickles and dimes Times gettin' rough I ain't got enough To buy me a bottle of wine Bottle of wine Fruit of the vine When you gonna let me get sober  Leave me alone Let me go home Let me go home and start over A pain in my head There's bugs in my bed My pants are so old that they shine Out on the street I beg the people I meet To buy me a bottle of wine 3X Bottle of wine Fruit of the vine When you gonna let me get sober  Leave me alone Let me go home Let me go home and start over Let me go home and start over Let me go home and start over
