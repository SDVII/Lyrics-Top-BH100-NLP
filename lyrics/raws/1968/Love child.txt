 Tenement slum Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ah  You think that I don't feel love But what I feel for you is real love In those eyes I see reflected A hurt scorned rejected Love child never meant to be Love child born in poverty Love child never meant to be Love child take a look at me Started my life in an old cold rundown Tenement slum  My father left he never even married Mom I shared the guilt my mama knew So afraid that others knew I had no name Ah this love we're contemplating Is worth the pain of waiting We'll only end up hating The child we may be creating Love child never meant to be  Love child  society Love child always second best  Love child different from the rest  Mmm baby  Mmm baby I started school in a worn torn dress that somebody threw out  I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt To be without the simple things So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me Ah don't think that I don't need you Don't think I don't wanna please you But no child of mine will be bearing The name of shame I've been wearing Love child love child never quite as good  Afraid ashamed misunderstood  But I'll always love you  I'll always love you  I'll always love you  Always love you  I'll always love you  Always love you  You you you  I'll always love you  Always love you  You  You  I'll always love you  Take a look take a look at me  Love child love child  I'll always love you
