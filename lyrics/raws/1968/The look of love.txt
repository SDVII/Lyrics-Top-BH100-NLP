The look of love is in your eyes A look that time can't disguise The look of love is saying so much more than just words could ever say And what my heart has heard well it takes my breath away I can hardly wait to hold you Feel my arms around you How long I have waited Waited just to love you Now that I have found you You've got the look of love It's on your face A look that time can't erase Be mine tonight Let this be just the start Of so many nights like this Let's take a lover's vow And then seal it with a kiss I can hardly wait to hold you Feel my arms around you How long I have waited Waited just to love you Now that I have found you Don't ever go
