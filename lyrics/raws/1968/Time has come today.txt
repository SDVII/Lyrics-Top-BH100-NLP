Time has come today Young hearts can go their way Can't put it off another day I don't care what others say They think we don't listen anyway Time has come today Oh The rules have changed today  I have no place to stay  I'm thinking about the subway  My love has flown away  My tears have come and gone  Oh my Lord I have to roam  I have no home  I have no home  Now the time has come  There's no place to run  I might get burned up by the sun  But I had my fun  I've been loved and put aside  I've been crushed by the tumbling tide  And my soul has been psychedelicized  Now the time has come  There are things to realize  Time has come today  Time has come today  Time Time Time Time Time Time Time Time Time Time Time Oh Now the time has come  There's no place to run  I might get burned up by the sun  But I had my fun  I've been loved and put aside  I've been crushed by tumbling tide  And my soul has been psychedelicized  Now the time has come  There are things to realize  Time has come today  Time has come today  Time Time Time Time Yeah
