Only you Can hear my soul Serenade I want to be free to fly away and sing to the world About my soul serenade my soul serenade When you re not around there s a lonely sound In my soul serenade in my soul serenade Everyone but you adores me But do you know pretty soon they bore me Let me tell you right now that they bore me They bore me with their pretty little words Those pretty little words of devotion But oh let me tell you right now My message to em this evening Is they can jump in anybody s ocean Because only you hear my soul My soul serenade my soul serenade Oh my soul serenade my soul serenade
