If you stay stay darling You make me so proud stay darling Please stay To the world I'd cry my love How I love you Honey I love you I really love you Please please please stay darling And I will never never let you down Just say you'll stay Cause I'll need you always around To tell me you love me Honey you love me so darling stay There'll be times when I may fail I'll need your love to comfort me Bitter days may prevail but just a kiss from you Will make them sweet stay But just a kiss from you Will make them sweet Honey I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you Don t you know baby I love you I love you
