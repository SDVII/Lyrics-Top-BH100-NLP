Never gonna give you up No matter how you treat me Never gonna give you up So don't you think of leavin' Girl you treat me bad and I know why Yeah I've seen you runnin' around with another guy And you think if you hurt me that I'll go away Made it up in my mind that I'm here to stay So tell him Whisper in his ear You tell him that Jerry said he'll never let you go Hey don't you understand What you're doing to the man  Do you see these tears here in my eyes  Ain't no use in me lyin' 'cause I really cried You think you're gonna take me and put me on the shelf Girl I'd rather die than see you with somebody else So throw it out of your mind I'll never leave you Though you grieve me and deceive me mama yeah Hey don't you understand What you're doing to the man  My friends all say that I'm your fool And you're using me like a carpenter uses a tool And I know their intentions are all very good Some of them would help me if they could But I'll never never never never never let you go baby  No matter what you say Babe don't you understand That you're killing this man  Never gonna give you up No matter what you do to me baby now One of these days I'll be standin' around your door
