When I think back On all the crap I learned in high school It s a wonder I can think at all And though my lack of education Hasn t hurt me none I can read the writing on the wall Kodachrome They give us those nice bright colors They give us the greens of summers Makes you think all the world s a sunny day Oh yeah I got a Nikon camera I love to take a photograph So mama don t take my Kodachrome away If you took all the girls I knew When I was single And brought them all together for one night I know they d never match My sweet imagination Everything looks worse in black and white Kodachrome They give us those nice bright colors They give us the greens of summers Makes you think all the world s a sunny day Oh yeah I got a Nikon camera I love to take a photograph So mama don t take my Kodachrome away Mama don t take my Kodachrome away Mama don t take my Kodachrome away Mama don t take my Kodachrome away Mama don t take my Kodachrome Mama don t take my Kodachrome Mama don t take my Kodachrome away Mama don t take my Kodachrome Leave your boy so far from home Mama don t take my Kodachrome away Mama don t take my Kodachrome Mama don t take my Kodachrome away  Outro
