Got on board a westbound seven forty seven Didn't think before deciding what to do Ooh that talk of opportunities TV breaks and movies Rang true sure rang true    Seems it never rains in southern California Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before It never rains in California but girl don't they warn ya  It pours man it pours I'm out of work I'm out of my head Out of self respect I'm out of bread I'm underloved I'm underfed I want to go home It never rains in California but girl don't they warn ya  It pours man it pours Will you tell the folks back home I nearly made it  Had offers but didn't know which one to take Please don't tell 'em how you found me Don't tell 'em how you found me Gimme a break give me a break
