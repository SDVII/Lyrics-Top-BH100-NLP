Every day the sun comes up around her She can make the birds sing harmony Every drop of rain is glad it found her Heaven must have made her just for me When she smiles so warm and tender A sight for sore eyes to see Oooh  Oh no they don't come better She don't ask for things no diamond rings Like pages in a letter She can fill me up when it's down I'm goin'  Put a little music in my day Wouldn't be surprised if my love keeps growin'  Bigger every minute that she stays away I would kiss the ground she walks on 'Cause it's my word my word she'll obey now Woo ooh   Well I kiss the ground she walks on She's a real good friend right to the end A lonely man when she's gone Oooh  What a good good thing I've got She means to me a lot No no they don't come better She don't ask for things no diamond rings Like pages in a letter Well I kiss the ground she walks on I'm a lonely man when my baby's gone
