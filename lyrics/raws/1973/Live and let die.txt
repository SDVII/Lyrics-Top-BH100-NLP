When you were young and your heart was an open book You used to say live and let live But if this ever changing world in which we're living Makes you give in and cry Say live and let die Live and let die let it die What does it matter to you  When you got a job to do You gotta do it well You got to give the other fellow hell You used to say live and let live But if this ever changing world in which we're living Makes you give in and cry Say live and let die Yeah live and let die let it die
