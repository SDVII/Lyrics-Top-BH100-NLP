Why do I keep my mind on you all the time  And I don't even know you  Why do I feel this way thinking about you every day  And I don't even know you  Take me in your arms Thrill me with all of your charms And I'll take to the sky on a natural high  Loving you more till the day I die  Take to the sky on a natural high  Loving you more    If you have anything to do call me and I will do it for you And I don't even know you  If I only had one wish to give That wish would be for you to live forever and ever  When I see you on the street My heart skips a beat And I'll take to the sky on a natural high  Loving you more till the day I die  Take to the sky on a natural high  Loving you more    I'm gonna try to do all the things you want me to If you just give me a chance  I'm trying to make something out of nothing And I don't even know you  Take me in your arms Thrill me with all of your charms And I'll take to the sky on a natural high Loving you more till the day I die Take to the sky on a natural high Loving you more    And I'll take to the sky on a natural high Loving you more till the day I die Take to the sky on a natural high Loving loving you Take to the sky on a natural high Loving you more till the day I die Take to the sky on a natural high Loving loving you
