Ha ha ha I don't believe it Da da ah ooh don't touch me Hey Ray  Hey Sugar  Tell 'em who we are Well we're big rock singers We got golden fingers And we're loved everywhere we go  We sing about beauty And we sing about truth At ten thousand dollars a show  We take all kind of pills That give us all kind of thrills But the thrill we've never known Is the thrill that'll get ya When you get your picture On the cover of the Rolling Stone  Wanna see my picture on the cover  Wanna buy five copies for my mother   Wanna see my smilin' face On the cover of the Rolling Stone  I got a freaky ol' lady name o' Cocaine Katy Who embroiders on my jeans I got my poor old gray haired daddy Drivin' my limousine Now it's all designed to blow our minds But our minds won't really be blown Like the blow that'll get ya when you get your picture On the cover of the Rolling Stone  Wanna see our pictures on the cover  Wanna buy five copies for our mothers   Wanna see my smilin' face On the cover of the Rolling Stone We got a lot of little teenage blue eyed groupies Who do anything we say We got a genuine Indian guru Who's teaching us a better way We got all the friends that money can buy So we never have to be alone And we keep getting richer but we can't get our picture On the cover of the Rolling Stone  Wanna see my picture on the cover  Wanna buy five copies for my mother   Wanna see my smilin' face On the cover of the Rolling Stone On the cover of the Rolling Stone Wanna see my picture on the cover Wanna buy five copies for my mother  I ain't kiddin' why we would make a beautiful cover On the cover of the Rolling Stone
