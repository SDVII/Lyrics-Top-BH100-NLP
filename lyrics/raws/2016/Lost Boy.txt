There was a time when I was alone Nowhere to go and no place to call home My only friend was the man in the Moon And even sometimes he would go away too Then one night as I closed my eyes I saw a shadow flying high He came to me with the sweetest smile Told me he wanted to talk for a while He said  Peter Pan that's what they call me I promise that you'll never be lonely  And ever since that day    I am a Lost Boy from Neverland Usually hanging out with Peter Pan and And when we're bored we play in the woods Always on the run from Captain Hook  Run run Lost Boy  they say to me Away from all of reality Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me And Lost Boys like me are free Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me And Lost Boys like me are free He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe Believe in him and believe in me Together we will fly away in a cloud of green To your beautiful destiny As we soared above the town that never loved me I realized I finally had a family Soon enough we reached Neverland Peacefully my feet hit the sand And ever since that day    I am a Lost Boy from Neverland Usually hanging out with Peter Pan and And when we're bored we play in the woods Always on the run from Captain Hook  Run run Lost Boy  they say to me Away from all of reality Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me And Lost Boys like me are free Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me And Lost Boys like me are free Peter Pan Tinker Bell Wendy Darling Even Captain Hook you are my perfect storybook Neverland I love you so you are now my home sweet home Forever a Lost Boy at last Peter Pan Tinker Bell Wendy Darling Even Captain Hook you are my perfect storybook Neverland I love you so you are now my home sweet home Forever a Lost Boy at last And for always I will say    I am a Lost Boy from Neverland Usually hanging out with Peter Pan and And when we're bored we play in the Woods Always on the run from Captain Hook  Run run Lost Boy  they say to me Away from all of reality Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me And Lost Boys like me are free Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me And Lost Boys like me are free
