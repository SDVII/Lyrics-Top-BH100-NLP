I got this feeling inside my bones It goes electric wavey when I turn it on All through my city all through my home We're flying up no ceiling when we in our zone I got that sunshine in my pocket Got that good soul in my feet I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops I can't take my eyes up off it moving so phenomenally Room on lock the way we rock it so don't stop And under the lights when everything goes Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close When we move well you already know So just imagine just imagine just imagine Nothing I can see but you when you dance dance dance A feeling good good creeping up on you So just dance dance dance come on All those things I shouldn't do But you dance dance dance And ain't nobody leaving soon so keep dancing I can't stop the feeling So just dance dance dance I can't stop the feeling So just dance dance dance  Ooh it's something magical It's in the air it's in my blood it's rushing on I don't need no reason don't need control I fly so high no ceiling when I'm in my zone 'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket Got that good soul in my feet I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops I can't take my eyes up off it moving so phenomenally Room on lock the way we rock it so don't stop And under the lights when everything goes Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close When we move well you already know So just imagine just imagine just imagine Nothing I can see but you when you dance dance dance A feeling good good creeping up on you So just dance dance dance come on All those things I shouldn't do But you dance dance dance And ain't nobody leaving soon so keep dancing I can't stop the feeling So just dance dance dance I can't stop the feeling So just dance dance dance  I can't stop the feeling So just dance dance dance I can't stop the feeling So keep dancing  I can't stop the I can't stop the I can't stop the I can't stop the I can't stop the feeling Nothing I can see but you when you dance dance dance Feeling good good creeping up on you So just dance dance dance come on All those things I shouldn't do But you dance dance dance And ain't nobody leaving soon so keep dancing Everybody sing Got this feeling in my body Got this feeling in my body Wanna see you move your body Got this feeling in my body come on Break it down Got this feeling in my body Can't stop the feeling Got this feeling in my body come on
