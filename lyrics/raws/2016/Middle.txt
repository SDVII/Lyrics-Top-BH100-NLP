Starin' at two different views on your window ledge Coffee has gone cold it's like time froze There you go wishin' floatin' down our wishin' well It's like I'm always causin' problems causin' hell I didn't mean to put you through this I can tell Are we gonna sweep this under the carpet  I hope that I can turn back the time To make it all alright all alright for us I'll promise to build a new world For us two with you in the middle Lyin' down beside you what's goin' through your head  The silence in the air felt like my soul froze Am I just overthinkin' feelings I can sell  This gut feelin' I'm tryna get off me as well I hope we find our missin' pieces and just chill Are we gonna sweep it under the carpet  I hope that I can turn back the time To make it all alright all alright for us I'll promise to build a new world For us two with you in the middle Thank the children just thank the children Thank the children just thank the children
