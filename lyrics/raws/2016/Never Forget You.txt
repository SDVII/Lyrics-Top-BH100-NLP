I used to be so happy but without you here I feel so low I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go 'Cause once upon a time you were my everything It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing It's buried deep inside me but I feel there's somethin' you should know I will never forget you You will always be by my side From the day that I met you I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die And I will never want much more And in my heart I will always be sure I will never forget you And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die 'Til the day I die 'Til the day I die 'Til the day I die Funny how we both end up here but everything seems so right I wonder what would happen if we went back and put up a fight 'Cause once upon a time you were my everything It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing So what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind   I will never forget you You will always be by my side  From the day that I met you  I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die And I will never want much more And in my heart I will always be sure  I will never forget you  And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die Feelin' it lovin' it everything that we do And all along I knew I had somethin' special with you But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through But I'm still tied and I can't hide my connection with you Feelin' it lovin' it everything that we do And all along I knew I had something special with you But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through I can't hide my connection with you I will never forget you And you will always be by my side  From the day that I met you  I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die And I will never want much more And in my heart I will always be sure  That I will never forget you  And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die Die yeah 'Til the day I die 'til the day I die 'til the day I die Oh yeah yeah oh 'Til the day I die 'til the day I die 'til the day I die And you will always be by my side I will never forget you I will never never never never Never never never never I will never forget you 'til the day I die
