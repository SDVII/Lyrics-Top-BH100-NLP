Do doo doo wah shoo be doo be Do doo doo wah shoo be doo be How can you tell me How much you miss me When the last time I saw you You wouldn't even kiss me That rich guy you've been seein' Must have put you down So welcome back baby To the poor side of town To him you were nothin' But a little plaything  Not much more than An overnight fling  To me you were the greatest thing This boy had ever found And girl it's hard to find nice things On the poor side of town I can't blame you for tryin' I'm tryin' to make it too I've got one little hang up baby I just can't make it without you  So tell me Are you gonna stay now  Will you stand by me girl All the way now  With you by my side They can't keep us down Together we can make it baby From the poor side of town Oh with you by my side This world can't keep us down Together we can make it baby From the poor side of town Do doo doo wah shoo be doo be Do doo doo wah shoo be doo be Do doo doo wah shoo be doo be
