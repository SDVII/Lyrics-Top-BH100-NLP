This old heart of mine been broke a thousand times Each time you break away I fear you've gone to stay Lonely nights that come memories that flow bringing you back again Hurting me more and more Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside  Cause each day that passes by you got me Never knowing if I'm coming or going but I I love you This old heart darling is weak for you I love you yes I do These old arms of mine miss having you around  Makes these tears inside start a falling down Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside  Cause each day that passes by you got me Never knowing if I'm coming or going but I I love you This old heart darling is weak for you I love you yes I do  Yes I do I try hard to hide my hurt inside This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin' I try hard to hide my hurt inside This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin' the way you treat me Leaves me incomplete you're here for the day gone for the week now But if you leave me a hundred times A hundred times I'll take you back I'm yours whenever you want me I'm not too proud to shout it Tell the world about it cause I love you Yes I do  Yes I do I love you  This old heart darling is weak for you
