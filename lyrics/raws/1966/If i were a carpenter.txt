If I were a carpenter And you were a lady Would you marry me anyway  Would you have my baby  If a tinker were my trade Would you still find me Carrin' the pots I made Followin' behind me Save my love through loneliness Save my love for sorrow I'm given you my onliness Come give your tomorrow If I worked my hands in wood Would you still love me  Answer me babe  Yes I would I'll put you above me   If I were a miller At a mill wheel grinding Would you miss your color box And your soft shoe shining  If I were a carpenter And you were a lady Would you marry me anyway  Would you have my baby  Would you marry anyway  Would you have my baby
