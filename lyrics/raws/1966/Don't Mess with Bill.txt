Don't mess with Bill Don't mess with Bill Say it one more time Well I know he's the guy who put tears in my eyes A thousand times or more Oh but every time he would apologize I loved him more than before Hear what I say girls keep away Don't mess with Bill Leave my Billy alone Get a guy of your own Now there's Johnny there's Joe And there's Frank and Jim Just to name a few Now Bill's got me and I've got him I'm sure there's one for you Hear what I say girls keep away Don't mess with Bill He's mine all mine I say it one more time Though I tell myself he wants no one else 'Cause he keeps coming back to me Now I'm in no position to want competition I want to be sure as can be Hear what I say girls keep away Don't mess with Bill Leave my Billy alone Get a guy of your own 'Cause he's mine all mine I say it one more time Hey yeah yeah yeah Hey yeah yeah yeah
