Hey baby I lied about thinking about you  wondering where you are You should come over I have a surprise for you Here I am roamin' out on the street No one's around to see The dust and the salt have covered my feet And then she came 'round to me Her hair is so long and her eyes are so smooth The words that she's speaks aren't true My baby looks lonely but she's feeling good She does what she wants to do She's so cool She's a moon woman she's in my heart She's a cruel woman at least so far She's a moon woman she's in my heart She's a cruel woman at least so far I'll follow her anywhere that she goes Her gaze makes my bones so cold She knows everything that I'll ever know Her body is cast in gold My baby's got other things on her mind Where no ones allowed inside It's okay with me I'll take in her view Shes all that I want to do She's so cool She's a moon woman she's in my heart She's a cruel woman at least so far She's a moon woman she's in my heart She's a cruel woman at least so far That is how we do it in the 780 All over the map y'all  We Out here Check you on the flip side  Peace
