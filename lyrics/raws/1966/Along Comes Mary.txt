Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely Someone calls on me And every now and then I spend my time in rhyme and verse And curse those faults in me And then along comes Mary And does she want to give me kicks And be my steady chick and give me pick of memories Or maybe rather gather tales From all the fails and tribulations no one ever sees When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks Whose sickness is the games they play And when the masquerade is played the neighbor folks make jokes At who is most to blame today And then along comes Mary And does she want to set them free And let them see reality from where she got her name And will they struggle much when told That such a tender touch as hers will make them not the same When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch And when the morning of the warning's passed The gassed and flaccid kids are flung across the stars The psychodramas and the traumas gone The songs are left unsung and hung upon the scars And then along comes Mary And does she want to see the stains The dead remains of all the pains she left the night before Or will their waking eyes reflect the lies And make them realize their urgent cry for sight no more When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch Sweet as the punch Sweet as the punch Sweet as the punch Sweet as the punch
