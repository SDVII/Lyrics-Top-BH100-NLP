Well take me back down where cool water flow yeh Let me remember things I love ah Stoppin' at the log where catfish bite Walkin' along the river road at night Barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight I can hear the bull frog callin' me oh Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree Love to kick my feet way down the shallow water Shoe fly dragon fly get back to your mother Pick up a flat rock skip it across Green River Waaah Up at Cody's camp I spent my days oh With flat car riders and cross tie walkers Old Cody Junior took me over Said you're gonna find the world is smouldrin' An' if you get lost come on home to Green River Waaah Come on home
