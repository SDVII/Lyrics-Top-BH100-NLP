You played hooky from school And you can't go out to play yeah Mama said for the rest of the week In your room you gotta stay yeah Now you feel like The whole world's pickin' on you But deep down inside you know it ain't true You've been punished cause your mother Wants to raise you the right way yeah But you don't care Cause you already made up your mind You want to run away yeah You're on your way Run away child running wild Run away child running wild Better come back home Better come back home Where you belong Where you belong Roaming through the city Going nowhere fast You're on your own at last Hey it's getting late where will you sleep Gettin' kinda hungry You forgot to bring something to eat Oh lost with no money you start to cry But remember you left home Wanting to be grown So dry your weepin' eyes Siren screamin' down neon light is flickin' You want your mama Ah there's nothing for you You're frightened and confused I want my mama But she's much too far away She can't hear a word you say You heard some frightening news on the radio About little boys running away from home And their parents don't see them no more You want to hitch a ride and go home But your mama told you never trust a stranger And you don't know which way to go Streets are dark and deserted Not a sound nor sign of life How you long to hear your mother's voice Cause you're lost and alone But remember you make the choice Run away child running wild Better go back home where you belong Run away child running wild Better go back home where you belong You're lost in this great big city Not one familiar face Ain't it a pity Oh run away child running wild You better go back home where you belong Mama mama please come and see about me But she's much too far away She can't hear a word you say I want my mama You're frightened and confused Which way will you choose
