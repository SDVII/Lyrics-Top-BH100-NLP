Galveston oh Galveston I still hear your sea winds blowin' I still see her dark eyes glowin' She was twenty one when I left Galveston Galveston oh Galveston I still hear your sea waves crashing While I watch the cannons flashing I clean my gun and dream of Galveston I still see her standing by the water Standing there lookin' out to sea And is she waiting there for me  On the beach where we used to run Galveston oh Galveston I am so afraid of dying Before I dry the tears she's crying Before I watch your sea birds flying in the sun At Galveston at Galveston
