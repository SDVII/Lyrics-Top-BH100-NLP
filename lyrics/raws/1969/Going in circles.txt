I'm an ever rollin' wheel without a destination real I'm an ever spinning top whirling around till i drop Oh but what am i to do my mind is in a whirlpool Give me a little hope one small thing to cling to You got me going in circles You got me going in circles I'm a faceless clock with timeless hopes that never stop Lord but i feel that way of my soul  My soul is stay Oh but what am i to do my mind is in a whirlpool Give me a little hope one small thing to cling to You got me going in circles You got me going in circles  I'm spun out over you  over you  spun out over you I'm spun i said i'm spun out over you Spun out over you
