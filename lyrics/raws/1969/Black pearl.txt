Black pearl precious little girl Let me put you up where you belong Black pearl little girl You been in the background much too long You been working so hard your whole life through Tendin' other people's houses Raisin' up their children too Hey how about something for me and you Here in my arms you're gonna reign supreme No more servin' baby They're gonna serve my queen It's our turn for happiness and our day has come Living for each other answering to no one Black pearl precious little girl Let me put you up where you belong Because I love you Black pearl pretty little girl You been in the background much too long Together we'll stand so straight and so tall Created by love to love one and all Hey heart to heart soul to soul No other one could ever take your place My world is built around The very smile that's on your face You'll never win a beauty show No they won't pick you But you're my miss America I love you
