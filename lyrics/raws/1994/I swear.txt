 I swear by the moon And the stars in the sky And I swear like the shadow that s by your side I see the questions in your eyes I know what s weighing on your mind You can be sure I know my part Cause I stand beside you through the years You ll only cry those happy tears And though I make mistakes I ll never break your heart And I swear by the moon And the stars in the sky I ll be there I swear like the shadow that s by your side I ll be there for better or worse Till death do us part I ll love you with every beat of my heart And I swear Oooh I ll give you everything I can I ll build your dreams with these two hands We ll hang some memories on the walls And when just the two of us are there You won t have to ask if I still care Cause as the time turns the page My love won t age at all And I swear by the moon And the stars in the sky I ll be there I swear like the shadow that s by your side I ll be there for better or worse Til death do us part I ll love you With every beat of my heart and I swear Oh yeah I swear by the moon And the stars in the sky I ll be there I swear like the shadow that s by your side I ll be there For better or worse Till death do us part I ll love you With every single beat of my heart I swear I swear Oh I swear
