OPENING THEME Luke goes on a a run around Manhattan as Trish Talk plays in the background TRISH If you re just joining us this is Trish Talk and we are discussing the recent events that have the residents of Harlem confused and some even frightened Line one Sophia you re on the air SOPHIA Luke Cage is turning the neighborhood upside down and giving it a good shake Trust me no one wants to see what falls out TRISH Are you suggesting we turn a blind eye to the problems in our city SOPHIA No but I seen the news The man is so strong he doesn t have to answer to anybody Can you trust a person like that Let the police do their jobs That s what I say TRISH Some would argue the boys in blue don t exactly have a sterling reputation these days SOPHIA Oh yeah missy Well the next time trouble comes banging at your door maybe you should call Luke Cage instead of 911 TRISH You know what Sophia I just might Uh let s take another caller Line two Hi Amir AMIR Hey Trish I want to respond to that lady cause she s got it all wrong I know Luke He comes into the fish fry Always treats my wife and me with respect Last week two kids started a fight Luke took care of it and nobody got hurt TRISH I think it s noteworthy that the only people I ve spoken to that criticize are the ones who don t know him personally So many others have merely read about him or saw him on the news and jumped to conclusions AMIR Trish Luke is good people and he belongs right here in Harlem TRISH And I think it s important for all of us to realize something We are witnessing a massive shift in the boundaries of possibility But what is scary to some inspires hope in others I for one would like to thank Luke Cage for all the work he s doing in Harlem Those of us below 110th see the good work he s doing and we hope he s doing well THE WATERFRONT Cottonmouth sans minions meets Scarfe COTTONMOUTH I never thought I d be happy to see your ugly face SCARFE Well we all can t be as pretty as you COTTONMOUTH Ain

I am Harlem CAMERAMAN And we re live THEMBI Which Harlem is you MARIAH Pardon me THEMBI There are actually two Harlems The one shown to us in that video Historic hardworking and hopeful But in this next video we see an entirely different Harlem A historically corrupt Harlem The video is of Mariah s family photos THEMBI Your grandmother the notorious Mabel Stokes and her brother in law Pistol

that s a that s a personal photograph You you really uh have no right to show that one THEMBI Well how about this one Video from a news report about the Crispus Attucks attack THEMBI Somehow a brutal assault that took place at the Crispus Attucks Houses didn t make the news Even stranger was the millions of dollars in cash found on the premises in your office There s some people on the scene even describe a man who under a barrage of gunfire managed to beat down a number of criminals some of whom may have worked for your family So you can see how it might be difficult to decipher which Harlem you stand for MARIAH Despite these unwarranted attacks on my character I have always tried to make clear what I want which I can t say for you Thembi It s very clear what you and the rest of your media friends want You want a story Not the news Not the truth Just a story that you will do anything to sell Shut it down Stop Alex THEMBI Thank you for your time MARIAH You get your ass out of my

against something else She opens her eyes at the same time that Misty arrives on the scene They both see that Luke Cage stopped the car crumpling its whole front LUKE You okay CLAIRE Yeah LUKE At least I kept one promise No scratches on you Scarfe crumples to the ground Misty rushes to his side CLAIRE Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa Hold his head Hold my hand Look at me Look at me Breathe Breathe
