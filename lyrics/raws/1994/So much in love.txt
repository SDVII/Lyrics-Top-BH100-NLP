 As we stroll along together Holding hands walking all along So in love are we two That we don t know what to do So in love In a world of our own And as we walk by the sea together Under stars twinkling high above So in love are we two No one else but me and you So in love So much in love So in love So much in love We stroll along together I tell you I need you oh so much I love I love you my darling Can you tell it in my touch As we walk down the aisle together We will vow to be together til we die So in love are we two Just can t wait to say I do So in love In a world of our own So in love Are you and I Baby I hope you realize that you mean so much to me You re everything I ever wanted in a woman To touch you to feel your body close to me I just want to hold you in my arms forever I love you baby Can you tell it in my touch As we walk down the aisle together We will vow to be together til we die So in love are we two Just can t wait to say I do So in love Are you and I So in love Are you and I So in love So in love So in love So in love
