 In the thundering rain You stare into my eyes I can feel your hand Moving up my thighs Skirt around my waist Wall against my face I can feel your lips ooh I don t wanna stop just because People walking by are watching us I don t give a damn what they think I want you now I don t wanna stop just because You feel so good inside of my love I m not gonna stop no no no I want you All I wanna say is Any time And any place I don t care who s around mmm Any time And any place I don t care who s around no no no no no Dancing on the floor Feeling the slow groove My mind is starting to burn With forbidden thoughts Strangers all around With the lights down low I was thinking maybe we could Well you know I don t wanna stop just because People standing around are watching us I don t give a damn what they think I want you now I don t wanna stop just because You feel so good inside of my love I m not gonna stop no no no I want you All I wanna say is Any time And any place I don t care who s around Any time baby And any place I don t care who s around Any time And any place I don t care who s around Baby baby I don t care who s around Any time baby Any place sugar They pass they can stare I don t care who s around
