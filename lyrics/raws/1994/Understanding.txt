 What I need from you is understanding How can we communicate If you don t hear what I say What I need from you is understanding So simple as 1 2 3 Understanding is what we need You don t really know me You just wanna do what you wanna do That s not the way it should be No you should listen to me boy I try so very hard to make you understand But the choices you make baby they re all demands I try so very hard to keep our love alive But you don t wanna meet me half way Then the understanding dies There s no way that we can work it out If we don t pull together I don t mean to be demanding But I want some understanding I want to be with you I listen to you baby And I know the things you re going through I try to understand That s why I m still with you baby See everyday we re living Is one thing that will always be unsure That s why I need you baby pleading baby Please let our love endure
