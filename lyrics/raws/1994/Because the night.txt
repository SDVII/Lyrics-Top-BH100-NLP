 Take me now baby here as I am Hold me close and try and understand Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe Love is a banquet on which we feed Come on now try and understand The way I feel under your command Take my hand as the sun descends They can t hurt you now Can t hurt you now Can t hurt you now Because the night belongs to lovers Because the night belongs to us Because the night belongs to lovers Because the night belongs to us Have I doubt baby when I m alone Love is a ring a telephone Love is an angel disguised as lust Here in our bed til the morning comes Come on now try and understand The way I feel under your command Take my hand as the sun descends They can t hurt you now Can t hurt you now Can t hurt you now Because the night belongs to lovers Because the night belongs to us Because the night belongs to lovers Because the night belongs to us With love we sleep with doubt the vicious cycle turns and burns Without you oh I cannot live forgive the yearning Burning I believe it s time too real to feel So take me now take me now take me now Because the night belongs to lovers Because the night belongs to us Because the night belongs to lovers And everybody says that it belongs to us
