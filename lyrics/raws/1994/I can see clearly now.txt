I can see clearly now the rain is gone I can see all obstacles in my way Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind It s gonna be a bright Bright sun shining day It s gonna be a bright Bright sun shining day Oh yes I can make it now the pain is gone All of the bad feelings have disappeared Here is that rainbow I ve been praying for It s gonna be a bright Bright sun shining day Look all around there s nothing but blue skies Look straight ahead there s nothing but blue skies I can see clearly now the rain is gone I can see all obstacles in my way Here is that rainbow I ve been praying for It s gonna be a bright Bright sun shining day It s gonna be a bright Bright sun shining day It s going to be a bright Bright sun shining day It s gonna be a bright Bright sun shining day It s gonna be a bright Bright sun shining day It s gonna be a bright Bright sun shining day It s gonna be a bright Bright sun shining day
