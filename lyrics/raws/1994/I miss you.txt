I miss you I m talking to you baby I miss you I miss you I m talking to you baby I miss you We used to talk And laugh all night girl What happened to those days Did they all just fade away Holding you in my arms Made me feel so happy Then you said you had to go What s wrong baby I need to know But now it s a dream That I wish you could come Back and make come true But you re long gone away But now I m missing you I miss you yes I do From the bottom of my heart I miss you I m talking to you baby I miss you I miss you I m talking to you baby I miss you I thought you d be with me forever But I guess someone took my place Took the place of me loving you And making love to you all through the night I wish you were still here So I can see your pretty face again Please come back and rescue me From all this pain and misery But now it s a dream And I wish you Could come back to make us true But you re long gone away But now I m missing you missing you Missing you Please understand how much I really miss you I ll do anything in this world To have you back again Missing you Missing you I miss you through winter spring The summer the fall When we were together I miss you I miss you From the bottom of my heart To the depths of my soul baby I miss you oh Give me the love back baby The way you used to hold me The way you used to kiss me I I I miss you I miss you Yes I do Yes I do I miss you Yes I do yes I do I miss you I really really do I really really do I miss you yes I do yes I do I miss you so bad Everytime I lay at night all I do is cry I do love you baby I miss you I miss you yes I do yes I do I m talking to you baby call me Call me baby call me baby come Give your loving back to me yes I do yes I do I miss you I m talking to you baby I miss you I miss you I miss you I miss you I miss you I miss you
