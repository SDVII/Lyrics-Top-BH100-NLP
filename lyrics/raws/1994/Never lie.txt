 Friends come a dime a dozen But I know that I will never find a friend like you And that s why I wanna sing this song Wherever you are Wherever I just want to let you know That I will never lie again I promise I will never lie again Cause you ll always be my friend I will never lie again Cause a friend like you will last forever Sitting in my window I m thinking of you All the fun things we used to do I feel the pain please come back to me Cause a friend like you will only come once in a lifetime I will never lie again Cause you ll always be my friend I will never lie again Cause a friend like you will last forever On the phone when you were here Laughing and joking crying and sulking In my dreams you re still with me Cause a friend like you only comes once in a lifetime I will never lie again Cause you ll always be my friend I will never lie again Cause a friend like you will last forever When I think of you I think of someone special And how it used to be yeah I know you ll always be my friend I m so sad it had to end I will never lie again Cause you ll always be my friend I will never lie again Cause a friend like you will last forever I will never lie again Cause you ll always be my friend I will never lie again Cause a friend like you will last forever I will never lie again Cause you ll always
