 I m still alive but I m barely breathing Just praying to a God that I don t believe in Cause I got time while she got freedom Cause when a heart breaks no it don t break even Her best days will be some of my worst She finally met a man that s gonna put her first While I m wide awake she s no trouble sleeping Cause when a heart breaks no it don t breakeven Even no What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you And what am I supposed to say when I m all choked up and you re ok I m falling to pieces yeah I m falling to pieces They say bad things happen for a reason But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding Cause she s moved on while I m still grieving And when a heart breaks no it don t breakeven even even no What am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you And what am I supposed to say when I m all choked up and you re ok I m falling to pieces yeah I m falling to pieces yeah I m falling to pieces I m falling to pieces Oh you got his heart and my heart and none of the pain You took your suitcase I took the blame Now I m tryna make sense of what little remains oh Cause you left me with no love and no love to my name I m still alive but I m barely breathing Just prayed to a God that I don t believe in Cause I got time while she got freedom Cause when a heart breaks no it don t break No it don t break no it don t break even no What am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you And what am I supposed to say when I m all choked up that you re ok I m falling to pieces yeah I m falling to pieces yeah I m falling to pieces I m falling to pieces Oh it don t break even no Oh it don t break even no Oh it don t break even no
