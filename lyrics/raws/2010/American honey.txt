 She grew up on the side of the road Where the church bells ring and strong love grows She grew up good she grew up slow Like American honey Steady as a preacher free as a weed Couldn t wait to get goin but wasn t quite ready to leave So innocent pure and sweet American honey There s a wild wild whisper blowin in the wind Callin out my name like a long lost friend Oh I miss those days as the years go by Oh nothin sweeter than summertime And American honey Get caught in the race of this crazy life Tryin to be everything can make you lose your mind I just want to go back in time To American honey There s a wild wild whisper blowin in the wind Callin out my name like a long lost friend Oh I miss those days as the years go by Oh nothin sweeter than summertime And American honey Gone for so long now I got to get back to her somehow To American honey There s a wild wild whisper blowin in the wind Callin out my name like a long lost friend Oh I miss those days as the years go by Oh nothin sweeter than summertime And American honey And American honey
