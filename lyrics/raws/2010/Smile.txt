 You re better than the best I m lucky just to linger in your light Cooler than the flip side of my pillow that s right Completely unaware Nothing can compare to where you send me It lets me know that it s okay And the moments when my good times start to fade You make me smile like the sun Fall outta bed Sing like a bird Dizzy in my head Spin like a record Crazy on a Sunday night You make me dance like a fool Forget how to breathe Shine like gold Buzz like a bee Just the thought of you can drive me wild Oh you make me smile Even when you re gone Somehow you come along Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack And just like that You steal away the rain And just like that You make me smile like the sun Fall outta bed Sing like a bird Dizzy in my head Spin like a record Crazy on a Sunday night You make me dance like a fool Forget how to breathe Shine like gold Buzz like a bee Just the thought of you can drive me wild Oh you make me smile
