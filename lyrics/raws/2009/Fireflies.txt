 You would not believe your eyes If ten million fireflies Lit up the world as I fell asleep Cause they d fill the open air And leave teardrops everywhere You d think me rude but I would just stand and stare I d like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It s hard to say that I d rather stay awake when I m asleep Cause everything is never as it seems Cause I d get a thousand hugs From ten thousand lightning bugs As they tried to teach me how to dance A foxtrot above my head A sock hop beneath my bed The disco ball is just hanging by a thread I d like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It s hard to say that I d rather stay awake when I m asleep Cause everything is never as it seems Leave my door open just a crack Cause I feel like such an insomniac Why do I tire of counting sheep When I m far too tired to fall asleep To ten million fireflies I m weird cause I hate goodbyes I got misty eyes as they said farewell But I ll know where several are If my dreams get real bizarre Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar I d like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It s hard to say that I d rather stay awake when I m asleep Cause everything is never as it seems I d like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It s hard to say that I d rather stay awake when I m asleep Cause everything is never as it seems I d like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It s hard to say that I d rather stay awake when I m asleep Because my dreams are bursting at the seams
