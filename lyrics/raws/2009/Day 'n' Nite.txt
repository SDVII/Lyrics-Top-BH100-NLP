Uh uh uh uh uh uh Day and night I toss and turn I keep stressing my mind mind I look for peace but see I don t attain What I need for keeps this silly game we play play Now look at this Madness to magnet keeps attracting me me I try to run but see I m not that fast I think I m first but surely finish last last Cuz day and night The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night He s all alone through the day and night The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night Day and night The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night He s all alone some things will never change The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night Hold the phone The lonely stoner mr solo doe low He s on the move can t seem to shake the shade Within his dreams he see s the life he made made The pain is deep A silent sleeper you won t hear a peep peep The girl he wants don t see no one into It seems the feelings that she had are through through Cuz day and night The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night He s all alone through the day and night The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night Day and night The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night He s all alone some things will never change The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night Slow moe When the temple slows up and creates that new new He seems alive though he is feeling blue The sun is shining man he s super cool cool The lonely nights They fade away he slips into his white nights He smokes a clip and then he s on the way To free his mind in search of To free his mind in search of To free his mind in search of Cuz day and night The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night He s all alone through the day and night The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night Day and night The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night He s all alone some things will never change The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night At at at night
