 She s staring at me I m sitting wondering what she s thinking Nobody s talking cause talking just turns into screaming And now as I m yelling over her she yelling over me All that that means is neither of us are listening And what s even worse that we don t even remember why we re fighting So both of us are mad for nothing Nothing Nothing When we won t let it go for nothing Nothing It should be nothing To a love like what we got oh baby I know sometimes it s gonna rain But baby can we make up now Cause I can t sleep through the pain Girl I don t want to go to bed mad at you And I don t want you to go to bed mad at me No I don t want to go to bed mad at you And I don t want you to go to bed mad at me Oh no no no And it gets me upset girl when you re constantly accusing We re fighting this war but baby both of us are losing What happened to working it out We fall into this place where you ain t backing down And I ain t backing down So what the hell do we do now It s all for nothing Nothing Nothing We won t let it go for nothing Nothing It should be nothing To a love like what we got oh baby I know sometimes it s gonna rain But baby can we make up now Cause I can t sleep through the pain Girl I don t want to go to bed mad at you And I don t want you to go to bed mad at me No I don t want to go to bed mad at you And I don t want you to go to bed mad at me Oh no no no Oh baby this love ain t gonna be perfect oh no And just how good it s gonna be We can fuss and we can fight As long as everything s alright between us Before we go to sleep Baby we re gonna be happy baby I know sometimes it s gonna rain But baby can we make up now Cause I can t sleep through the pain Girl I don t want to go to bed mad at you And I don t want you to go to bed mad at me No I don t want to go to bed mad at you And I don t want you to go to bed mad at me Oh no no no
