Show me a river that's so deep Show me a mountain so high I'll show you love that'll last forever Flying high so high Ah show me a place where dreams are for dreamers And all the things you wish come true yeah I'd wish the world had all happy people Then there'd be no more wishing to do Oh oh oh oh oh  Sweet love  Oh oh oh oh oh  Sweet love  Oh oh oh oh oh ooh Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo ooh well Sweet love Sweet love that comes through the ages Reach out and touch my soul Gave my life so much meaning And everyone a heart of gold Oh oh oh oh oh  Sweet love  Oh oh oh oh oh Sweet love  I know you're searchin' I know you're searchin' for a little love A little peace and understandin' And I know it's been hard tryin' to find your way But you got to keep on searchin' harder day by day 'Cause it's love love's the only way Oh oh   Sweet love  Oh oh oh oh oh  Sweet love  Oh oh oh oh oh  Sweet love
