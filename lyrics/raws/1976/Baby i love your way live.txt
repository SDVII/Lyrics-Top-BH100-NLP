Shadows grow so long before my eyes And they're moving across the page Suddenly the day turns into night Far away from the city Don't hesitate 'Cause your love won't wait Ooh baby I love your way Wanna tell you I love your way Wanna be with you night and day Moon appears to shine and light the sky With the help of some fireflies I wonder how they have the power to shine shine shine I can see them under the pine But don't hesitate 'Cause your love won't wait yeah Ooh baby I love your way Wanna tell you I love your way Wanna be with you night and day Well don't don't hesitate 'Cause your love won't wait I can see the sunset in your eyes Brown and gray blue besides Clouds are stalking islands in the sun I wish I could buy one Out of season But don't hesitate 'Cause your love won't wait oh Ooh baby I love your way Wanna tell you I love your way Wanna be with you night and day Ooh baby I love your way
