Every time  that I look in the mirror All these lines on my face getting clearer The past is gone it went by like dusk to dawn Isn't that the way everybody's got the dues in life to pay yeah I know nobody knows Where it comes and where it goes I know it's everybody sins You got to lose to know how to win Half my life's in books' written pages Lived and learned from fools and from sages You know it's true All the things come back to you Sing with me sing for the year Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Sing with me it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away Sing with me sing for the year Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Sing with me it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away Dream on dream on dream on Dream until your dream come true Dream on dream on dream on Dream until your dream come true Dream on dream on Dream on dream on Dream on dream on Dream on Sing with me sing for the year Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Sing with me it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away Sing with me sing for the year Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear Sing with me it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
