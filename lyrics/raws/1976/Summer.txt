Your sundress and bleach blonde hair Adolescent vacant stare My peace of mind Cure the thoughts swimming in my head Imprompt decisions Late nights in love Forgone conclusions Tell me what you're thinking of Just leave me out to dry Been lost here for the longest time I can't even win I'll just breathe you in It's the end of an era It's a fall from grace You said you needed time You said you needed space And no simple lie It's wishful thinking You and I Felt like dreaming But you left me out to dry I've been living off of borrowed time I can't even win I'll just breathe you in It's the end of an era It's a fall from grace You said you needed time You said you needed space You can leave if you wanna Someone will take my place So in the meantime Can we fade away  I used to know who you were Now I know who you're not Forgetting all that I learned Such a freeing thought Do I miss you when I have nothing else  Can I win when I'm losing myself  Was what we had even real  So I keep looking back And I refuse to believe that    It's the end of an era It's a fall from grace You said you needed time You said you needed space You can leave if you wanna Someone will take my place So in the meantime Can we fade away  Can we fade away
