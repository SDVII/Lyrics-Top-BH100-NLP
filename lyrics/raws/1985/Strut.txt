He said  Baby what's wrong with you  Why don't you use your imagination    Nations go to war over women like you It's just a form of appreciation   Come on over here lay your clothes on the chair Now let the lace fall across your shoulder   Standing in the half light you're almost like her So take it slow like your daddy told ya  Strut pout put it out That's what you want from women Come on baby whatcha takin' me for  Strut pout cut it out All takin' and no givin' Watch me baby while I walk out the door I said  Honey I don't like this game You make me feel like a girl for hire   All this fascination with leather and lace Is just the smoke from another fire  He said  Honey don't stop a speeding train Before it reaches it destination   Lie down here beside me oh have some fun too Don't turn away from your true vocation  Strut pout put it out That's what you want from women Come on baby whatcha takin' me for  Strut pout cut it out All takin' and no givin' Watch me baby while I walk out the door I won't be your baby doll Be your baby doll I won't be your baby doll Be your baby doll Strut pout put it out That's what you want from women Come on baby whatcha takin' me for  Strut pout cut it out All takin' and no givin' Watch me baby while I walk out the door Strut pout put it out That's what you want from women Come on baby whatcha takin' me for  Strut pout cut it out All takin' and no givin' Watch me baby while I walk out the door
