I've gotta take a little time A little time to think things over I better read between the lines In case I need it when I'm older Now this mountain I must climb Feels like a world upon my shoulders Through the clouds I see love shine It keeps me warm as life grows colder In my life there's been heartache and pain I don't know if I can face it again Can't stop now I've traveled so far To change this lonely life I wanna know what love is I want you to show me I wanna feel what love is I know you can show me I'm gonna take a little time A little time to look around me I've got nowhere left to hide It looks like love has finally found me In my life there's been heartache and pain I don't know if I can face it again Can't stop now I've traveled so far To change this lonely life I wanna know what love is I want you to show me I wanna feel what love is I know you can show me I wanna know what love is I want you to show me  I wanna feel what love is  I know you can show me Let's talk about love I wanna know what love is  I want you to show me  I wanna feel what love is  I know you can show me  I wanna know what love is  I want you can show me  I wanna feel what love is  I know you can show me  I wanna know what love is  I want you to show me I wanna feel what love is  I know you can show me
