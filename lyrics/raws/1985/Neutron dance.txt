I don't want to take it anymore I'll just stay here locked behind the door Just no time to stop and get away 'Cause I work so hard to make it everyday Whoo oooh Whoo oooh There's no money falling from the sky 'Cause a man took my heart and robbed me blind Someone stole my brand new Chevrolet And the rent is due I got no place to stay Whoo oooh Whoo oooh And it's hard to say Just how some things never change And it's hard to find Any strength to draw the line I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance Industry don't pay a price that's fair All the common people breathing filthy air Roof caved in on all the simple dreams And to get ahead your heart starts pumping schemes And it's hard to say Just how some things never change And it's hard to find Any strength to draw the line I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance Whoo oooh Whoo oooh I'm on fire I'm on fire And it's hard to say Just how some things never change And it's hard to find Any strength to draw the line I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance I know there's a pot of gold for me All I got to do is just believe I'm so happy doin' the neutron dance And I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance I'm so happy doin' the neutron dance I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance Whoo oooh Whoo oooh I'm so happy doin' the neutron dance I'm so happy doin' the neutron dance Whoo oooh Whoo oooh I'm so happy I'm just burning I'm so happy I'm just burning I'm so happy I'm just burning I'm so happy I'm just burning I'm so happy I'm just burning I'm so happy I'm just burning
