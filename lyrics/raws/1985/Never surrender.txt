Just a little more time Is all we're asking for Cause just a little more time Could open closing doors Just a little uncertainty Can bring you down And nobody wants to know you now And nobody wants to show you how So if you're lost and on your own You can never surrender And if your path won't lead you home You can never surrender And when the night is cold and dark You can see you can see light Cause no one can take away your right To fight and to never surrender With a little perseverance You can get things done Without the blind adherence That has conquered some And nobody wants to know you now And nobody wants to show you how So if you're lost and on your own You can never surrender And if your path won't lead you home You can never surrender And when the night is cold and dark You can see you can see light Cause no one can take away your right To fight and to never surrender To never surrender And when the night is cold and dark You can see you can see light No one can take away your right To fight and to never surrender To never surrender Oh time is all we're asking for To never surrender Oh oh you can never surrender Time is all you're asking for Stand your ground never surrender Oh oh oh oh I said You never surrender oh
