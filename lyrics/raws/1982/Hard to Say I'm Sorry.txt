Everybody needs a little time away I heard her say from each other Even lovers need a holiday Far away from each other Hold me now It's hard for me to say I'm sorry I just want you to stay After all that we've been through I will make it up to you I promise to And after all that's been said and done You're just a part of me I can't let go Couldn't stand to be kept away Just for the day from your body Wouldn't wanna be swept away Far away from the one that I love Hold me now It's hard for me to say I'm sorry I just want you to know Hold me now I really wanna tell you I'm sorry I could never let you go After all that we've been through I will make it up to you I promise to And after all that's been said and done You're just a part of me I can't let go After all that we've been through I will make it up to you I promise to You're gonna be the lucky one When we get there gonna jump in the air No one'll see us cause there's nobody there After all you know we really don't care Hold on I'm gonna take you there
