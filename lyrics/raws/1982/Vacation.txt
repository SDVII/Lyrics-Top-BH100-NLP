Can't seem to get my mind off of you Back here at home there's nothin' to do Now that I'm away I wish I'd stayed Tomorrow's a day of mine that you won't be in When you looked at me I should've run But I thought it was just for fun I see I was wrong And I'm not so strong I should've known all along that time would tell A week without you Thought I'd forget Two weeks without you and I Still haven't gotten over you yet Vacation all I ever wanted Vacation had to get away Vacation meant to be spent alone Vacation all I ever wanted Vacation had to get away Vacation meant to be spent alone A week without you Thought I'd forget Two weeks without you and I Still haven't gotten over you yet Vacation all I ever wanted Vacation had to get away Vacation meant to be spent alone Vacation all I ever wanted Vacation had to get away Vacation meant to be spent alone
