I should be saying goodnight I really shouldn't stay anymore It's been so long since I held you Forgotten what love is for I should run on the double  I think I'm in trouble  Trouble  Yes I think I'm in trouble Come come to me darling and hold me Let your honey keep you warm Been so long since I held you Forgotten what love is for I should run on the double  I think I'm in trouble  Trouble  Yes I think I'm in trouble  I think I'm in trouble I should run on the double  I think I'm in trouble  Trouble  I think I'm in trouble  I think I'm in trouble
