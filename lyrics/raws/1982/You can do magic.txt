I never believed in things that I couldn't see I said if I can't feel it then how can it be No no magic could happen to me And then I saw you I couldn't believe it you took my heart I couldn't retrieve it said to myself What's it all about Now I know there can be no doubt You can do magic You can have anything that you desire Magic and you know You're the one who can put out the fire You know darn well When you cast your spell you will get your way When you hypnotize with your eyes A heart of stone can turn to clay And when the rain is beatin' upon the window pane And when the night it gets so cold when I can't sleep Again you come to me I hold you tight the rain disappears Who would believe it With a word you dry my tears You can do magic You can have anything that you desire Magic and you know You're the one who can put out the fire You know darn well When you cast your spell you will get your way When you hypnotize with your eyes A heart of stone can turn to clay And if I wanted to I could never be free I never believed it was so true But now it's so clear to me You can do magic You can have anything that you desire Magic and you know You're the one who can put out the fire You know darn well When you cast your spell you will get your way When you hypnotize with your eyes A heart of stone can turn to clay
