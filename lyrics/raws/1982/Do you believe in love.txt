I was walking down a one way street Just a looking for someone to meet One woman who was looking for a man Now I'm hoping  that the feeling is right And I'm wondering  if you'll stay for the night So I'm coming  I want to love you all over Do you believe in love Do you believe it's true Do you believe in love Oh you're making me believe it too Now the feeling is beginning to grow And the meaning is something you only know If you believe it take my hand and I'll take your heart Come on Now I'm wondering  where does true love begin I'm going under  so I'm letting you in My woman  I want to love you all over Do you believe in love You believe it's true Oh you're making me believe it too I'm so glad it's changed Do you believe in love I'm so glad  I'm so glad  Oh you're making me believe it too girl Do you believe in love  Do you believe it's true  Do you believe in love  I believe in love too
