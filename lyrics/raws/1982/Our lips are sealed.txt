Can you hear them  They talk about us Telling lies Well that's no surprise Can you see them  See right through them They have a shield No secrets to reveal Doesn't matter what they say In the jealous games people play Our lips are sealed There's a weapon That we must use In our defense Silence When you look at them Look right through them That's when they'll disappear That's when we'll be feared Doesn't matter what they say In the jealous games people play Our lips are sealed Pay no mind to what they say Doesn't matter anyway Our lips are sealed Hush my darling Don't you cry Quiet angel Forget their lies Can you hear them  They talk about us Telling lies Well that's no surprise Can you see them  See right through them They have a shield No secrets to reveal Doesn't matter what they say In the jealous games people play Our lips are sealed Pay no mind to what they say Doesn't matter anyway Our lips are sealed Our lips are sealed Oh our lips are sealed
