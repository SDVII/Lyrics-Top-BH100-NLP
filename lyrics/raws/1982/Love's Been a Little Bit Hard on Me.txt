I've got nothing to be ashamed of If I shy away it's only because Oh love's been a little Ya know it's just been a little I can't remember when it meant so much Now I shy away from the slightest touch Oh love's been a little Just a little little Well come out come out From that hopeless romance in side Child it's all right it's all right Shade so dark so close to the light Well come out well come out From that hopeless romance in side Child it's all right it's all right Shade so dark so close to the light I'll be back when I calm my fears Then I'll see you 'round in a thousand years Oh love's been a little Oh love ya know it's just been a little It's hard on me
