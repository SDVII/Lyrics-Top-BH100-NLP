When you were just a young girl and still in school How come you never learned the golden rule  Don't talk to strange men don't be a fool I'm hearing stories  I don't think that's cool Why dont'cha tell me someone isn't lovin' you  'Cause you're my girl some say it's no longer true You're seeing some slick continental dude I'm beggin' you please Baby dont'cha talk You know he'll only use you up Don't talk Nobody nobody ever told you Now tell me how's life in the big city  I hear the competition's tough  baby that's a pity And every man's an actor  every girl is pretty I don't like what's gettin' back to me Now who's this Don Juan I've been hearing of  Love hurts when only one's in love Now did ya fall at first sight or did you need a shove  I'm beggin' you please Baby dont'cha talk You know he'll only use you up Don't talk Nobody nobody ever told you What's he sayin' baby  I asked you not to talk to him I'm begging you Baby dont'cha talk You know he'll only use you up Don't talk Nobody nobody ever told you Baby dont'cha talk You know he'll only use you up Baby dont'cha Baby dont'cha talk
