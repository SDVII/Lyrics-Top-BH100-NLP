 Oh don t you dare look back Just keep your eyes on me I said You re holding back She said Shut up and dance with me This woman is my destiny She said Oooooh shut up and dance with me We were victims of the night A chemical physical kryptonite Helpless to the bass and fading light Oh we were bound to get together Bound to get together She took my arm I don t know how it happened We took the floor and she said Oh don t you dare look back Just keep your eyes on me I said You re holding back She said Shut up and dance with me This woman is my destiny She said Oooooh shut up and dance with me A backless dress and some beat up sneaks My discotheque Juliet teenage dream I felt it in my chest since she looked at me I knew we were bound to be together Bound to be together She took my arm I don t know how it happened We took the floor and she said Oh don t you dare look back Just keep your eyes on me I said You re holding back She said Shut up and dance with me This woman is my destiny She said Oooooh shut up and dance with me Ohh c mon girl Deep in her eyes I think I see the future I realize this is my last chance She took my arm I don t know how it happened We took the floor and she said Oh don t you dare look back Just keep your eyes on me I said you re holding back She said Shut up and dance with me This woman is my destiny She said Oooooh shut up and dance Don t you dare look back Just keep your eyes on me I said You re holding back She said Shut up and dance with me This woman is my destiny She said Oooooh shut up and dance with me Oooooh shut up and dance with me Oooooh shut up and dance with me
