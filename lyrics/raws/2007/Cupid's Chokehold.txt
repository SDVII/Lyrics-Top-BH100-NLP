 Take a look at my girlfriend She s the only one I got Not much of a girlfriend I never seem to get a lot It s been some time since we ve last spoke This is gonna sound like a bad joke But Momma I fell in love again It s safe to say I have a new girlfriend And I know it sounds so old But Cupid got me in a chokehold And I m afraid I might give in Towel s on the mat my white flag is wavin I mean she even cooks me pancakes And Alka Seltzer when my tummy aches If that ain t love then I don t know what love is We even got a secret handshake And she loves the music that my band makes I know I m young but if I had to choose her or the sun I d be one nocturnal son of a gun Take a look at my girlfriend She s the only one I got Not much of a girlfriend I never seem to get a lot Take a look at my girlfriend She s the only one I got Not much of a girlfriend I never seem to get a lot It s been a while since we talked last And I m tryin hard not to talk fast But Dad I m finally thinkin I may have found the one Type of girl that ll make you way proud of your son And I know you heard the last song About the girls that didn t last long But I promise this is on a whole new plane I can tell by the way she says my name I love the way she calls my phone She s even got her very own ringtone If that ain t love then I don t know what love is It s gonna be a long drive home But I know as soon as I arrive home And I open the door take off my coat and throw my bag on the floor She ll be back into my arms once more for sure like Take a look at my girlfriend She s the only one I got Not much of a girlfriend I never seem to get a lot Take a look at my girlfriend She s the only one I got Not much of a girlfriend I never seem to get a lot She s got a smile that ll make the most senile Annoying old man bite his tongue She s got eyes comparable to sunrise And it doesn t stop there She s got porcelain skin of course she s a ten Now she s even got her own song She s got the cutest laugh I ve ever heard And we can be on the phone for three hours And I would still cherish every moment And when I start to build my future she s the main component Call it call it call it Or whatever you call it but Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like Take a look at my girlfriend She s the only one I got Not much of a girlfriend I never seem to get a lot Take a look at my girlfriend She s the only one I got Not much of a girlfriend I never seem to get a lot
