 I m going to make it bend and break Say a prayer but let the good times roll In case God doesn t show And I want these words to make things right But it s the wrongs that make the words come to life Who does he think he is If that s the worst you ve got Better put your fingers back to the keys One night and one more time Thanks for the memories Even though they weren t so great He tastes like you only sweeter One night yeah and one more time Thanks for the memories thanks for the memories See he tastes like you only sweeter Been looking forward to the future But my eyesight is going bad And this crystal ball It s always cloudy except for When you look into the past One night stand One night and one more time Thanks for the memories Even though they weren t so great He tastes like you only sweeter One night yeah and one more time Thanks for the memories thanks for the memories See he tastes like you only sweeter They say I only think in the form of crunching numbers In hotel rooms collecting page six lovers Get me out of my mind and get you out of those clothes I m a liner away from getting you into the mood whoa One night and one more time Thanks for the memories Even though they weren t so great He tastes like you only sweeter One night and one more time Thanks for the memories thanks for the memories See he tastes like you only sweeter One night and one more time Thanks for the memories Even though they weren t so great He tastes like you only sweeter One night and one more time Thanks for the memories thanks for the memories See he tastes like you only sweeter
