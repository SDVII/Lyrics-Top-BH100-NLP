 Paper bags and plastic hearts All belongings in shopping carts It s goodbye But we got one more night Let s get drunk and ride around And make peace with an empty town We can make it right Throw it away Forget yesterday We ll make the great escape And we won t hear a word they say They don t know us anyway Watch it burn Let it die Cause we are finally free tonight Tonight will change our lives It s so good to be by your side But we ll cry We won t give up the fight We ll scream loud at the top of our lungs And they ll think it s just cause we re young And we ll feel so alive Throw it away Forget yesterday We ll make the great escape And we won t hear a word they say They don t know us anyway Watch it burn Let it die Cause we are finally free tonight All of the wasted time Hours that were left behind me Answers that we ll never find They don t mean a thing tonight Throw it away Forget yesterday We ll make the great escape We won t hear a word they say They don t know us anyway Throw it away Forget yesterday We ll make the great escape Where we won t hear a word they say They don t know us anyway Throw it away Forget yesterday We ll make the great escape Where we won t hear a word they say They don t know us anyway Watch it burn Let it die Cause we are finally free tonight
