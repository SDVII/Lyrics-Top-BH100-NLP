 Last night I couldn t even get an answer I tried to call but my pride wouldn t let me dial And I m sitting here with this blank expression And the way I feel I wanna curl up like a child If I told you once I told you twice You can see it in my eyes I m all cried out with nothing to say You re everything I want it to be If you could only see your heart belongs to me I love you so much I m yearning for your touch Come and set me free forever yours I ll be Baby won t you come and take this pain away Last night I couldn t even get an answer I tried to call but my pride wouldn t let me dial And I m sitting here with this blank expression And the way I feel I wanna curl up like a child I need you and you need me This is so plain to see And I would never let you go And I will always love you so I will If you could only see your heart belongs to me I love you so much I m yearning for your touch Come and set me free forever yours I ll be Baby won t you come and take this pain away Last night I couldn t even get an answer I tried to call but my pride wouldn t let me dial And I m sitting here with this blank expression And the way I feel I wanna curl up like a child Tell me what words to say to make you comeback Don t break me like that And if it matters I d rather stay home With you I m never alone Don t wanna wait til you re gone Whatever you do just don t leave me Last night I couldn t even get an answer I tried to call but my pride wouldn t let me dial And I m sitting here with this blank expression And the way I feel I wanna curl up like a child I need you and you need me This is so plain to see And I would never let you go And I will always love you so I will If you could only see your heart belongs to me I love you so much I m yearning for your touch Come and set me free forever yours I ll be Baby won t you come and take my pain away Last night I couldn t even get an answer I tried to call but my pride wouldn t let me dial And I m sitting here with this blank expression And the way I feel I wanna curl up like a child Why don t you pick up the phone and dial up my number And call me up baby I m waiting on you Why don t you pick up the phone and dial up my number Just call me up baby I m waiting on you
