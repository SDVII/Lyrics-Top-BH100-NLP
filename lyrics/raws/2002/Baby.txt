 I don t remember feeling like this Baby Baby I love you Baby Baby I love you I got this jones forming in my bones Who indeed took over my soul I couldn t breathe if he ever said Get on my knees til they bloody red See I don t know if you get it yet He s like a lighter to my cigarette I never knew another human life Could have the power to take over mine So baby baby Baby baby baby baby baby Baby baby baby baby baby I love it when I hear your name got me saying Baby baby baby baby baby Baby baby baby baby baby See I could never feel alone with you I ll give up everything I own for you Almost a shame how I m mesmerized I lose my thought looking in your eyes Because your kisses make my lips quiver And when you touch me my whole body shivers Now I can see how another life Could have the power to take over mine Cause you re my Baby baby baby baby baby Baby baby baby baby baby I love it when I hear your name got me saying Baby baby baby baby baby Baby baby baby baby baby Break it down Baby I can t see my world Living here on God s green earth You don t know what you ve done to me I never thought I d need you desperately It s kind of sick how I m stuck on you But I don t care cause I m needing you And how I feel will remain the same Cause you re my baby Listen and when the world starts to stress me out It s to you boy without a doubt Who keeps me sane and I can t complain You re like a drug you relieve my pain You re like the blood flowing through my veins Keeps me alive and feeding my brain Now this is how another human life Could have the power to take over mine Cause you re my Baby baby baby baby baby Baby baby baby baby baby I love it when I hear your name got me saying Baby baby baby baby baby Baby baby baby baby baby Baby baby baby baby baby Baby baby baby Baby baby baby baby baby Baby baby baby baby baby Baby baby baby baby baby Baby baby baby baby baby Baby baby baby baby baby Baby baby baby baby baby
