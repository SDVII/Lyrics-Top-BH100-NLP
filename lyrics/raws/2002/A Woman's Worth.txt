 You could buy me diamonds you could buy me pearls Take me on a cruise around the world Dinner lit by candles run my bubble bath Make love tenderly to last and last Wanna please wanna keep wanna treat your woman right Not just dough but to show that you know she is worth your time You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first She will and she can find a man who knows her worth Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her And a real woman knows a real man ain t afraid to please her And a real woman knows a real man always comes first And a real man just can t deny a woman s worth Mmm hmm mmm hmm Mmm hmm mmm hmm Mmm mm If you treat me fairly I ll give you all my goods Treat you like a real woman should If you never play me promise not to bluff I ll hold you down when shit gets rough She walks the mile makes you smile all the while being true Don t take for granted the passions that she has for you You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first She will and she can find a man who knows her worth Ohh cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her And a real woman knows a real man ain t afraid to please her And a real woman knows a real man always comes first And a real man just can t deny a woman s worth No need to read between the lines spelled out for you Just hear this song cause you can t go wrong when you value A woman s woman s worth Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her And a real woman knows a real man ain t afraid to please her And a real woman knows a real man always comes first And a real man just can t deny a woman s worth Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her And a real woman knows a real man ain t afraid to please her And a real woman knows a real man always comes first And a real man just can t deny a woman s worth
