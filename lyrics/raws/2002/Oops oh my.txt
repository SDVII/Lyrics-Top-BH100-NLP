 Tell you what I did last night I came home say around a quarter to three Still so high hypnotized In a trance From his body so buttery brown and tantalizing You woulda thought I needed help From this feeling that I felt So shook I had to catch my breath Oops there goes my shirt up over my head Oh my Oops there goes my skirt droppin to my feet Oh my Ooh some kinda touch caressing my legs Oh my Ooh I m turning red Who could this be I tried and I tried to avoid But this thing was happening Swallowed my pride Let it ride and partied But this body felt just like mine I got worried I looked over to the left A reflection of myself That s why I couldn t catch my breath Oops there goes my shirt up over my head Oh my Oops there goes my skirt droppin to my feet Oh my Ooh some kinda touch caressing my legs Oh my Ooh I m turning red Who could this be Umm I was looking so good I couldn t reject myself Umm I was feeling so good I had to touch myself Umm I was eyeing my thighs butter pecan brown Umm comin outta my shirt and then the skirt came down
