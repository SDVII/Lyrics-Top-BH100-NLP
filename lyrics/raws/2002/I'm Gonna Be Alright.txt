 Oh yes Yes I did baby Yes I did It s funny cause for a while I walked around with a smile But deep inside I could hear Voices telling me this ain t right Don t you know he s not for you I always knew what I had to do But it s hard to get away Cause I love you I just tried to stay I used to say I couldn t do it but I did it After telling everybody that I wasn t with it Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it And I know inside I ma be alright I said I couldn t do it but I did it After telling everybody that I wasn t with it Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it And that voice inside says I m gonna be alright Friends of mine say to me Say you got control over me You re not alone I played my part I saw the way you were from the start Could I expect so much from you You had a girl when I first met you Did the best that you could do Now I realize that I can t change you I used to say I couldn t do it but I did it After telling everybody that I wasn t with it Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it And I know inside I ma be alright I said I couldn t do it but I did it After telling everybody that I wasn t with it Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it And that voice inside says I m gonna be alright Said I wouldn t walk away Some days I want to stay But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay Never thought it would be true Me living without you But now it s time for me to make that move oh woah Ah ah I used to say I couldn t do it but I did it After telling everybody that I wasn t with it Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it And I know inside I ma be alright I said I couldn t do it but I did it After telling everybody that I wasn t with it Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it And that voice inside says I m gonna be alright I used to say I couldn t do it but I did it After telling everybody that I wasn t with it Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it And I know inside I ma be alright I said I couldn t do it but I did it After telling everybody that I wasn t with it Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it And that voice inside says I m gonna be alright I used to say I couldn t do it but I did it After telling everybody that I wasn t with it Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it And I know inside I ma be alright I said I couldn t do it but I did it After telling everybody that I wasn t with it Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it And that voice inside says I m gonna be alright I used to say I couldn t do it but I did it After telling everybody that I wasn t with it Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it And I know inside I ma be alright
