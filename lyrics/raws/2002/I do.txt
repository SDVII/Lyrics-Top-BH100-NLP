 He was a six foot stallion Said a storybook thug He was the kind That made you wonder how he put down the love He had a hickey in his pocket A phat rock in his ear He made my heart stop pulpitating Every time he came near He has a spanking new Range for that tight wardrobe His pants was saggin He was plaided And his head was cornrows He has his wrists bling blinging And his long legs was bow He tried to push up on me But I knew he had me at go I do I wonder if you feel the same way I do I can see it in your eyes I entice you So come on shorty If you think you can roll With an iced out playa Balling out of control Me and my crew started grooving Made our way to the floor It s time to activate my plan And give this hottie a show I shook my hips Took a dip Roll my tongue cross my lips And when he took his place to dance wit me I felt fingertips on the small of my back So I had to react like I was playing hard to get And told that boy to step back But when I looked deep in his eyes All I could see was his soul I m bout to make this guy my man That I can tell you Fa sho Watch me Drop drop Shake it For the fellas who know Watch me pop Pop my hips As I dip and roll Watch me stop Stop traffic as I walk through the room Knowing all the papi s want me But all I want is you
