 My friend the communist Holds meetings in his RV I can t afford his gas So I m stuck here watching TV I don t have digital I don t have diddly squat It s not having what you want It s wanting what you ve got I m gonna soak up the sun Gonna tell everyone To lighten up I m gonna tell em that I ve got no one to blame For every time I feel lame I m looking up I m gonna soak up the sun I m gonna soak up the sun I ve got a crummy job It don t pay near enough To buy the things it takes To win me some of your love Every time I turn around I m looking up you re looking down Maybe something s wrong with you That makes you act the way you do Maybe I am crazy too I m gonna soak up the sun Gonna tell everyone To lighten up I m gonna tell em that I ve got no one to blame For every time I feel lame I m looking up I m gonna soak up the sun While it s still free I m gonna soak up the sun Before it goes out on me Don t have no master suite But I m still the king of me You have a fancy ride but baby I m the one who has the key Every time I turn around I m looking up you re looking down Maybe something s wrong with you That makes you act the way you do Maybe I am crazy too I m gonna soak up the sun Gonna tell everyone To lighten up I m gonna tell em that I ve got no one to blame For every time I feel lame I m looking up I m gonna soak up the sun I m gonna tell everyone To lighten up I m gonna tell em that I ve got no one to blame For every time I feel lame I m looking up I m gonna soak up the sun Got my 45 on So I can rock on
