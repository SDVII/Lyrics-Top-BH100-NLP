 There s a thousand words that I could say To make you come home yeah Seems so long ago you walked away Left me alone And I remember what you said to me You were acting so strange And maybe I was too blind to see That you needed a change Was it something I said To make you turn away To make you walk out and leave me cold If I could just find a way To make it so that you were right here Right now I ve been sitting here Can t get you off my mind I ve tried my best to be a man and be strong I drove myself insane Wishing I could touch your face But the truth remains you re Gone Gone Gone Gone Gone Now I don t wanna make excuses baby Won t change the fact that you re gone no no But if there s something that I could do Won t you please let me know The time is passing so slowly now Guess that s my life without you And maybe I could change my every day But baby I don t want to So I ll just hang around And find some things to do To take my mind off missing you take my mind off missing you And I know in my heart You can t say that you don t love me too Please say you do Ohhh What will I do If I can t be with you Tell me where will I turn to Baby who will I be Now that we are apart Am I still in your heart Baby why don t you see That I need you here with me Oohhh
