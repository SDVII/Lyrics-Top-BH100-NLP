David Lee Murphy Gettin Out The Good Stuff 100 Years Too Late When the sun is dawnin and he s just gettin up Starin out over the mornin through the steam off his coffee cup He thinks about a woman whose love he still holds dear A sweetheart he kept hangin on for way too many years It could ve been so different with a family and a wife But he was crossed between his feelings and that oklahoma sky Another time and in another place He might have rode with jesse james And though he rides he can t out run his fate cause he was born 100 years too late It s hard to imagine another world out there As he alys beside a campfire up in only god knows where But he feels the day approachin when the kind of life he s known Will only be in stories and sung about in songs Another time and in another place He might have rode with jesse james And though he rides he can t out run his fate cause he was born 100 years too late And he wouldn t trade one sleepless night beneath the pourin rain If he had it all to do over again he wouldn t change a thing Another time and in another place He might have rode with jesse james And though he rides he can t out run his fate cause he was born 100 years too late
