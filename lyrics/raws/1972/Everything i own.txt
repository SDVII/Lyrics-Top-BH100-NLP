You sheltered me from harm Kept me warm kept me warm You gave my life to me Set me free Set me free The finest years I ever knew Were all the years I had with you And I would give anything I own Would give up my life my heart my home I would give everything I own Just to have you back again You taught me how to love What it's of what it's of You never said too much But still you showed the way And I knew from watching you Nobody else could ever know The part of me that can't let go Is there someone you know You're loving them so But taking them all for granted  You may lose them one day Someone takes them away And they don't hear the words you long to say Just to touch you once again
