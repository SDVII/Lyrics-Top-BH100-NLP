It was late last night I was feeling something wasn't right There was not another soul in sight Only you only you So we walked along Though I knew that there was something wrong And a feeling hit me oh so strong About you Then you gazed up at me And the answer was plain to see 'Cause I saw the light In your eyes  In your eyes  Though we had our fling  I just never would suspect a thing  'Til that little bell began to ring  In my head in my head But I tried to run  Though I knew it wouldn't help me none  'Cause I couldn't ever love no one Or so I said But my feelings for you Were just something I never knew 'Til I saw the light In your eyes  In your eyes  But I love you best It's not something that I say in jest 'Cause you're different girl from all the rest In my eyes And I ran out before But I won't do it anymore Can't you see the light in my eyes  In my eyes  In my eyes  In my eyes  In my eyes
