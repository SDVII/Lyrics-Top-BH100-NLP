Raindrops keep fallin' on my head And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed Nothin' seems to fit Those raindrops are fallin' on my head they keep fallin' So I just did me some talkin' to the sun And I said I didn't like the way he got things done He's sleepin' on the job Those raindrops are fallin' on my head they keep fallin' But there's one thing I know The blues they send to greet me won't defeat me It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me Raindrops keep fallin' on my head But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red Crying's not for me Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin' Because I'm free Nothing's worryin' me  trumpet  It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me The raindrops keep fallin' on my head But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red Crying's not for me Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin' Because I'm free Nothing's worryin' me
