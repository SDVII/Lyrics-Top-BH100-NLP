Children play in the park they don't know I'm alone in the dark even though Time and time again I see your face smiling inside I'm so happy That you love me Life is lovely When you're near me Tell me you will stay Make me smile Living life is just a game so they say All the games we used to play fade away We may now enjoy the dreams we shared so long ago Oh my darling Got to have you Feel the magic When I hold you Cry sweet tears of joy Touch the sky Now I need you More than ever No more crying We're together Tell me you will stay Make me smile
