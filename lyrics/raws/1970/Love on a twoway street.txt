I found love on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highway Love on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highway True love will never die so I've been told but now I must cry It's finally goodbye I know With music softly playing his lips were gently saying   I love you  He held me in desperation I thought it was a revelation And then he walked out How could I be so blind to give up love for the very first time To be fooled is a hurting pain to be loved and fooled Is a crying shame while I bear the blame as he laughs my name With music softly playing his lips were gently saying   Honey I love you   He held me in desperation I thought it was a revelation And then he walked out I found love on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highway Love on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highway I found love on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highway Love on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highway
