 Absolutely nothing  Absolutely nothing  Absolutely nothing War is something that I despise Because it means destruction of innocent lives War means tears in thousands of mothers' eyes When their sons go out to fight and lose their lives I said  good God y'all  Absolutely nothing say it again  Absolutely nothing  It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker  Friend only to the undertaker War is the enemy of all mankind The thought of war blows my mind War has caused unrest within the younger generation Induction then destruction  Who wants to die   good God y'all  Absolutely nothing say it say it say it  Absolutely nothing  It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker  Its only friend is the undertaker War has shattered many young men's dreams Made them disabled bitter and mean Life is much too short and precious to be fighting wars these days War can't give life it can only take it away  good God y'all  Absolutely nothing say it  Absolutely nothing Listen to me  It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker  Friend only to the undertaker Peace love and understanding Tell me is there no place for them today  They say we must fight to keep our freedom But Lord knows there's gotta be a better way  good God y'all  You tell me say it say it say it say it  good God y'all  Stand up and shout it
