There's rumors of war Men dying and women crying If you breathe air you'll die Perhaps you wonder the reason why But wait  Don't you worry A new day is dawning We'll catch the sun and away we'll fly    Are you ready to sit by His throne  Are you ready not to be alone  Someone's coming to take you home And if you're ready then He'll carry you home People say that He won't come And I don't know what say you But if He should would you be the one  I've got a little question I'd like to ask you Are you ready to sit by His throne  Are you ready not to be alone  Someone's coming to take you home And if you're ready then He'll carry you home Brothers and sisters I have many Stumbling along to do their thing Love is a song it's better than any It's better for music it's easy to sing Are you ready to sit by His throne  Are you ready not to be alone  Someone's coming to take you home And if you're ready then He'll carry you home Are you ready to sit by His throne  Are you ready not to be alone  Someone's coming to take you home And if you're ready then He'll carry you home Are you ready   Are you ready   I've got to know yeah  You sound real good  Are you ready   Gonna be sunshine again  And the flowers growing  Children playing  Gonna be all right  You've got to be ready  I know you're ready  Say it loud one more time  Oh yeah
