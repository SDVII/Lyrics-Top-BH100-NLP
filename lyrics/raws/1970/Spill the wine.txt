I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest In a big field of tall grass I laid there in the sun and felt it caressing my face As I fell asleep and dreamed I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie And that I was the star of the movie This really blew my mind The fact that me an overfed long haired leaping gnome Should be the star of a Hollywood movie But there I was I was taken to a place The hall of the mountain kings I stood high by the mountain tops Naked to the world In front of Every kind of girl There was long ones tall ones short ones brown ones Black ones round ones big ones crazy ones Out of the middle came a lady She whispered in my ear Something crazy She said    Spill the wine take that pearl Spill the wine take that pearl Spill the wine take that pearl Spill the wine take that pearl I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared but soon she returned In her hand was a bottle of wine In the other a glass She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass And raised it to her lips And just before she drank it she said Spill the wine take that pearl Spill the wine take that pearl Spill the wine take that pearl Spill the wine take that pearl It's on girl all you gotta do is spill that wine Spill that wine let me feel let me feel hot yeah  yeah  Spill the wine spill the wine spill the wine spill the wine Spill the wine spill the wine spill the wine Take that pearl
