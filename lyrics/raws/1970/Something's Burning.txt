You lie in gentle sleep beside me I hear your warm and rhythmic breathing I take your hand and hold it tightly Listen can you not hear our young hearts beating I kiss the sleep from your eyes Your smile is sweeter than the morning And a here it comes Can't you feel it baby Can't you feel it here it comes Feel it feel it Fire fire Something's burning Something's burning Something's burning And I think it's love And now the sun is burning brightly We lie in love so close together I get the feeling deep inside me My love for you will burn forever I cup my hands to touch your face And once again I feel your fire And a here it comes Can't you feel it baby Can't you feel it here it comes again Feel it feel it Fire fire Something's burning Something's burning Something's burning And I think it's love And I think it's love And I think it's love And I think it's love Can't you feel the fire Keeps burnin' Can't you feel the fire Keeps burnin' Can't you feel the fire Keeps burnin' And I think it's love And I think it's love Can't you feel the fire Keeps burnin' Can't you feel the fire Keeps burnin' Can't you feel the fire Keeps burnin' And I think it's love And I think it's love
