You're sweet  as a honeybee But like a honeybee stings You've gone and left my heart in pain All you left  is our favorite song The one we danced to all night long It used to bring sweet memories  Of a tender love that used to be Now it's the same old song But with a different meaning since you been gone It's the same same old song But with a different meaning  And it breaks me up to hear it Ah oh ah sentimental fool am I  To hear a old love song and want to cry But the melody keeps haunting me Reminding me how in love we used to be Keep hearing the part that used to touch our hearts Staying  Darling   Can't bear to hear it Oh it hurts to hear it It's the same old song But with a different meaning since you been gone Precious memories keep a lingering on Every time I hear our favorite song Now you've gone Left this emptiness I only reminisce the happiness we spent We used to dance to the music  Make romance to the music  Now it's the same old song But with a different meaning since you been gone Now it's the same old song But with a different meaning since you been gone I oh I can't bear to hear it It's the same old song Ooh it breaks me up to hear it  It's the same old song But with a different meaning
