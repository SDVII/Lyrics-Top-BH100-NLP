Why can I be like any guy  Why do they try and make me run  Son of a gun Now what do they care about the clothes I wear  Why get their kicks from making fun Yeah this world's got a lot of space And if they don't like my face It ain't me that's going any where no So I don't care then laugh at me If that's so fair I have to beg to be free Then baby laugh at me and I'll cry for you And I'll pray for you and I'll do all the things That the man up stairs says to do I'll do 'em for you I'll do 'em I'll do 'em all for you It's gotta start some place It's gotta start some how I'll make that other cheek mine And maybe the next guy That don't wear a silk tie He can walk by and say hi Say hi instead of why Instead of why Instead of why babe Instead of why What did I do to you
