Down in the boondocks down in the boondocks People put me down cause that's the side of town I was born in I love her and she loves me but I don't fit in her society Lord have mercy I'm a boy from down in the boondocks Now every night I watch the lights from the house upon the hill Well I love a little girl who lives up there and I guess I always will But I don't dare knock on her door cause her daddy is my boss man So I'll just have to be content and see her whenever I can Take a trip on down in the boondocks Take a ride on down in the boondocks People put me down cause that's the side of town I was born in See I love her and she loves me but I don't fit her society Lord have mercy I'm a boy from down in the boondocks One fine day I'll find a way and move from this old shack Well I'll hold my head up like a king and I'll never never will look back 'Til that morning I'll work and slave and I'll save every dime But tonight she'll have to steal away to see me one more time Get together darling down in the boondocks Making love darling down in the boondocks People put me down cause that's the side of town I was born in I love her and she loves me but I don't fit her society Lord have mercy I'm a boy from down in the boondocks People put me down cause that's the side of town I was born in I love her and she loves me but I don't fit her society Lord have mercy I'm a boy from down in the boondocks Songwriter   Joe South
