Just look at you sitting there You never looked better than tonight And it would be so easy to tell you I'd stay Like I've done so many times I was so sure that this would be the night You'd close the door and wanna stay with me And it'd be so easy to tell you I'd wait Like I've done so many times Don't fall in love with a dreamer 'Cause he'll always take you in Just when you think you've really changed him He'll leave you again Don't you fall in love with a dreamer 'Cause he'll break you every time Put out the light and just hold on Before we say goodbye Now it's morning the phone rings And you say you've gotta get your things together You just gotta leave before you change your mind And if you knew what I was thinking girl I'd turn around if you'd just ask me one more time Don't fall in love with a dreamer 'Cause he'll always take you in Just when you think you've really changed him He'll leave you again Don't fall in love with a dreamer 'Cause he'll break you every time Put out the light and just hold on Before we say goodbye Before we said goodbye Goodbye
