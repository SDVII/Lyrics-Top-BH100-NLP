Girl close your eyes Let that rhythm get into you Don't try to fight it There ain't nothin' that you can do Relax your mind Lay back and groove with mine You got to feel that heat And we can ride the boogie Share that beat of love I wanna rock with you  Dance you into day  I wanna rock with you  We're gonna rock the night away Out on the floor There ain't nobody there but us Girl when you dance There's a magic that must be love Just take it slow Cause we got so far to go When you feel that heat And we're gonna ride the boogie Share that beat of love I wanna rock with you  Dance you into day  I wanna rock with you  We're gonna rock the night away And when the groove is dead and gone  You know that love survives So we can rock forever on I wanna rock with you I wanna groove with you I wanna rock with you I wanna groove with you I wanna rock  With you girl  Rock with you rock with you girl  Dance the night away I wanna rock with you  Rock you into day  I wanna rock with you  Rock the night away Feel the heat feel the beat  Rock you into day  I wanna rock  Rock the night away
