I used to hurry a lot I used to worry a lot I used to stay out till the break of day Oh that didn't get it It was high time I quit it I just couldn't carry on that way Oh I did some damage I know it's true Didn't know I was so lonely till I found you You can go the distance We'll find out in the long run  We can handle some resistance If our love is a strong one  People talking about us They got nothin' else to do When it all comes down we will Still come through In the long run Ooh I want to tell you it's a long run You know I don't understand why you don't Treat yourself better Do the crazy things that you do Cause all the debutantes in Houston baby Couldn't hold a candle to you Did you do it for love  Did you do it for money  Did you do it for spite  Did you think you had to honey  Who is gonna make it  We'll find out in the long run  I know we can take it If our love is a strong one  Well we're scared but we ain't shaking Kinda bent but we ain't breaking In the long run Ooh I want to tell you it's a long run In the long run In the long run Gonna find out ooh fa fa fa find out Long long long long long long long long Ooh run run run baby run run baby Long long long long
