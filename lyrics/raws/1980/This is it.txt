There've been times in my life I've been wondering why Still somehow I believed we'd always survive Now I'm not so sure you're waiting to hear One good reason to try But what more can I say What's left to provide Are you gonna wait for a sign your miracle Stand up and fight Make no mistake where you are Your back's to the corner Don't be a fool anymore The waiting is over no room to run No way to hide No time for wonderin' why It's here the moment is now about to decide Let 'em believe Leave 'em behind But keep me near in your heart Know whatever you do I'm here by your side For once in your life Here's your miracle Stand up and fight Make no mistake where you are You're goin' no further Until it's over and done Whoa oh ho whoa aaah It's not up to me this time Comes a day in every life Make no mistake where you are You're goin' no further Until it's over and done One way or another Your back's to the corner The waiting is over You're goin' no further
