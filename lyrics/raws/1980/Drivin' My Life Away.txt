Well the midnight headlights blind you on a rainy night Steep grade up ahead slow me down makin' no time Gotta keep rollin' Those windshield wipers slappin out a tempo Keepin perfect rhythm with the song on the radio Gotta keep rollin' Ooh I'm drivin' my life away lookin' for a better way for me Ooh I'm drivin' my life away lookin' for a sunny day Well the truck stop cutie comin' on to me Tried to talk me into a ride said I wouldn't be sorry But she was just a baby Hey waitress pour me another cup of coffee Pop me down jack me up shoot me out Flyin' down the highway Lookin' for the mornin' Ooh I'm drivin' my life away lookin' for a better way for me Ooh I'm drivin'  my life away lookin' for a sunny day Well the midnight headlight find you on a rainy night Steep grade up ahead slow me down makin no time Gotta keep rollin' Those windshield wipers slappin' out a tempo Keepin perfect rhythm with the song on the radio Gotta keep rollin' Ooh I'm drivin' my life away lookin' for a better way for me Ooh I'm drivin' my life away lookin' for a sunny day
