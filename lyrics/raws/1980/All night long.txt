We get up early and we work all day We put our time in cause we like to stay up All night long All night long We keep on grinnin' 'til the weekend comes Just a pinch between your cheek and gums All night long All night long Start in the morning and get the job done Take care of business and we have some fun All night long All night long We like a long neck and a good old song Turn it up and then we'll sing along Sing along Oh we're stayin' up all night long All night long All night long All night long All night long Songwriter   Joe Walsh
