 B B Be careful making wishes in the dark dark Can t be sure when they ve hit their mark And besides in the mean meantime I m just dreaming of tearing you apart I m in the de details with the devil So now the world can never get me on my level I just got to get you out of the cage I m a young lovers rage Gonna need a spark to ignite My songs know what you did in the dark So light em up up up Light em up up up Light em up up up I m on fire So light em up up up Light em up up up Light em up up up I m on fire In the dark dark In the dark dark The writers keep writing what they write Somewhere another pretty vein just dies I ve got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see That you re the antidote to everything except for me A constellation of tears on your lashes Burn everything you love Then burn the ashes In the end everything collides My childhood spat back out the monster that you see My songs know what you did in the dark So light em up up up Light em up up up Light em up up up I m on fire So light em up up up Light em up up up Light em up up up I m on fire In the dark dark In the dark dark My songs know what you did in the dark So light em up up up Light em up up up Light em up up up I m on fire So light em up up up Light em up up up Light em up up up I m on fire In the dark dark In the dark dark
