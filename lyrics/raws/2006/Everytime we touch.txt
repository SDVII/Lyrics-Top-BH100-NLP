 I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me I still feel your touch in my dream Forgive me my weakness but I don t know why Without you it s hard to survive Cause everytime we touch I get this feeling And everytime we kiss I swear I could fly Can t you feel my heart beat fast I want this to last Need you by my side Cause everytime we touch I feel the static And everytime we kiss I reach for the sky Can t you hear my heart beat so I can t let you go Want you in my life Your arms are my castle your heart is my sky They wipe away tears that I cry The good and the bad times we ve been through them all You make me rise when I fall Cause everytime we touch I get this feeling And everytime we kiss I swear I could fly Can t you feel my heart beat fast I want this to last Need you by my side Cause everytime we touch I feel the static And everytime we kiss I reach for the sky Can t you hear my heart beat so I can t let you go Want you in my life Cause everytime we touch I get this feeling And everytime we kiss I swear I could fly Can t you feel my heart beat fast I want this to last Need you by my side
