 Whooo umm yeah Life is like a road that you travel on When there is one day here and the next day gone Sometimes you bend sometimes you stand Sometimes you turn your back to the wind There is a world outside every darkened door Where blues will not haunt you anymore Where brave are free and lovers soar Come ride with me to the distant shore We won t hesitate To break down the garden gate There s not much time left today Life is a highway I want to ride it all night long If you are going my way I want to drive it all night long Through all these cities and all these towns It is in my blood and it is all around I love you now like I loved you then This is the road and these are the hands From Mozambique to those Memphis nights The Khyber Pass to Vancouver s lights Knock me down get back up again You are in my blood I am not a lonely man There is no load I cannot hold Road so rough this I know I will be there when the light comes in Just tell them we are survivors Life is a highway I want to ride it all night long If you are going my way I want to drive it all night long Give me give me give me give me yeah Life is a highway I want to ride it all night long If you are going my way I want to drive it all night long There was a distance between you and I A misunderstanding once But now we look it in the eye Ooh yeah There ain t no load that I can t hold The roads are rough this I know I ll be there when the light comes in Just tell them we re survivors Life is a highway I want to ride it all night long If you re going my way I want to drive it all night long Life is a highway I want to ride it all night long If you re going my way I want to drive it all night long Life is a highway I want to ride it all night long If you re going my way I want to drive it all night long Give me give me give me give me yeah
