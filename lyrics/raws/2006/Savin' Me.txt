 Prison gates won t open up for me On these hands and knees I m crawlin Oh I reach for you Well I m terrified of these four walls These iron bars can t hold my soul in All I need is you And oh I scream for you Show me what it s like And teach me wrong from right And say it for me say it to me And I ll leave this life behind me Say it if it s worth savin me Heaven s gates won t open up for me With these broken wings I m fallin All I see is you These city walls ain t got no love for me I m on the ledge of the eighteenth story Oh I scream for you And all I need from you Show me what it s like And teach me wrong from right And say it for me say it to me And I ll leave this life behind me Say it if it s worth savin me Hurry I m fallin And all I need is you And oh I scream for you Show me what it s like And teach me wrong from right And say it for me say it to me And I ll leave this life behind me Say it if it s worth saving me And say it for me say it to me And I ll leave this life behind me Say it if it s worth savin me
