1,"Love Yourself",Justin Bieber,2016,b"For all the times that you rained on my parade\nAnd all the clubs you get in using my name\nYou think you broke my heart oh girl for goodness sake\nYou think I'm cryin' on my own well I ain't\nAnd I didn't wanna write a song\n'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care\nI don't but you still hit my phone up\nAnd baby I'll be movin' on\nAnd I think you should be somethin'\nI don't wanna hold back\nMaybe you should know that\nMy mama don't like you and she likes everyone\nAnd I never like to admit that I was wrong\nAnd I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on\nBut now I know I'm better sleeping on my own\n'Cause if you like the way you look that much\nOh baby you should go and love yourself\nAnd if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'\nYou should go and love yourself\nBut when you told me that you hated my friends\nThe only problem was with you and not them\nAnd every time you told me my opinion was wrong\nAnd tried to make me forget where I came from\nAnd I didn't wanna write a song\n'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care\nI don't but you still hit my phone up\nAnd baby I'll be movin' on\nAnd I think you should be somethin'\nI don't wanna hold back\nMaybe you should know that\nMy mama don't like you and she likes everyone\nAnd I never like to admit that I was wrong\nAnd I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on\nBut now I know I'm better sleeping on my own\n'Cause if you like the way you look that much\nOh baby you should go and love yourself\nAnd if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'\nYou should go and love yourself\nFor all the times that you made me feel small\nI fell in love now I feel nothin' at all\nI never felt so low and I was vulnerable\nWas I a fool to let you break down my walls?\n'Cause if you like the way you look that much\nOh baby you should go and love yourself\nAnd if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'\nYou should go and love yourself\n'Cause if you like the way you look that much\nOh baby you should go and love yourself\nAnd if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'\nYou should go and love yourself"
2,"Sorry",Justin Bieber,2016,b"You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty\nYou know I try but I don't do too well with apologies\nI hope I don't run out of time could someone call a referee?\nCause I just need one more shot at forgiveness\nI know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice\nBy once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times\nSo let me oh let me redeem oh redeem oh myself tonight\nCause I just need one more shot at second chances\nYeah is it too late now to say sorry?\nCause I'm missing more than just your body\nIs it too late now to say sorry?\nYeah I know that I let you down\nIs it too late to say I'm sorry now?\nI'm sorry yeah\nSorry yeah\nSorry\nYeah I know that I let you down\nIs it too late to say I'm sorry now?\nI'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to\nBut you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two\nI'll go I'll go and then you go you go out and spill the truth\nCan we both say the words and forget this?\nIs it too late now to say sorry?\nCause I'm missing more than just your body\nIs it too late now to say sorry?\nYeah I know that I let you down\nIs it too late to say I'm sorry now?\nI'm not just trying to get you back on me\nCause I'm missing more than just your body\nIs it too late now to say sorry?\nYeah I know that I let you down\nIs it too late to say I'm sorry now?\nI'm sorry yeah\nSorry oh\nSorry\nYeah I know that I let you down\nIs it too late to say I'm sorry now?\nI'm sorry yeah\nSorry oh\nSorry\nYeah I know that I let you down\nIs it too late to say I'm sorry now?"
