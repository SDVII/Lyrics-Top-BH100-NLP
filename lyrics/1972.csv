2,Alone Again (Naturally),Gilbert O'Sullivan,1972,"b""In a little while from now\nIf I'm not feeling any less sour\nI promised myself to treat myself\nAnd visit a nearby tower\nAnd climbing to the top\nWill throw myself off\nIn an effort to make it clear to whoever\nWhat it's like when you're shattered\nLeft standing in the lurch at a church\nWere people are saying\nMy God that's tough she stood him up\nNo point in us remaining\nWe may as well go home\nAs I did on my own\nAlone again naturally\nTo think that only yesterday\nI was cheerful bright and gay\nLooking forward to but who wouldn't do\nThe role I was about to play\nBut as if to knock me down\nReality came around\nAnd without so much as a mere touch\nCut me into little pieces\nLeaving me to doubt\nAll about God and His mercy\nFor if He really does exist\nWhy did He desert me\nIn my hour of need?\nI truly am indeed\nAlone again naturally\nIt seems to me that\nThere are more hearts\nBroken in the world\nThat can't be mended\nLeft unattended\nWhat do we do?\nWhat do we do?\nAlone again naturally\nNow looking back over the years\nAnd what ever else that appears\nI remember I cried when my father died\nNever wishing to hide the tears\nAnd at sixty-five years old\nMy mother God rest her soul\nCouldn't understand why the only man\nShe had ever loved had been taken\nLeaving her to start with a heart\nSo badly broken\nDespite encouragement from me\nNo words were ever spoken\nAnd when she passed away\nI cried and cried all day\nAlone again naturally\nAlone again naturally"""
3,American Pie,Don McLean,1972,"b'A long long time ago...\nI can still remember\nHow that music used to make me smile\nAnd I knew if I had my chance\nThat I could make those people dance\nAnd maybe they\xe2\x80\x99d be happy for a while\nBut February made me shiver\nWith every paper I\xe2\x80\x99d deliver\nBad news on the doorstep;\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take one more step\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t remember if I cried\nWhen I read about his widowed bride\nBut something touched me deep inside\nThe day the music died\nSo bye-bye Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry\nAnd them good old boys were drinking whiskey \'n rye\nSinging ""This\xe2\x80\x99ll be the day that I die\n""This\xe2\x80\x99ll be the day that I die.""\nDid you write the book of love\nAnd do you have faith in God above\nIf the Bible tells you so?\nDo you believe in rock \xe2\x80\x99n\' roll\nCan music save your mortal soul\nAnd can you teach me how to dance real slow?\nWell I know that you\xe2\x80\x99re in love with him\n`Cause I saw you dancin\xe2\x80\x99 in the gym\nYou both kicked off your shoes\nMan I dig those rhythm and blues\nI was a lonely teenage broncin\xe2\x80\x99 buck\nWith a pink carnation and a pickup truck\nBut I knew I was out of luck\nThe day the music died\nI started singing\nBye bye Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was

that came from you and me\nOh and while the king was looking down\nThe jester stole his thorny crown\nThe courtroom was adjourned;\nNo verdict was returned\nAnd while Lennon read a book on Marx\nThe quartet practiced in the park\nAnd we sang dirges in the dark\nThe day the music died\nWe were singing\nBye bye Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry\nAnd them good old

fallout shelter\nEight miles high and falling fast\nIt landed foul on the grass\nThe players tried for a forward pass\nWith the jester on the sidelines in a cast\nNow the half-time air was sweet perfume\nWhile the sergeants played a marching tune\nWe all got up to dance\nOh but we never got the chance!\n`Cause the players tried to take the field;\nThe marching band refused to yield\nDo you recall what was revealed\nThe day the music died?\nWe started singing\nBye bye Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry\nAnd them good old boys were drinking whiskey \'n

again\nSo come on: Jack be nimble Jack be quick!\nJack Flash sat on a candlestick\nCause fire is the devil\xe2\x80\x99s only friend\nOh and as I watched him on the stage\nMy hands were clenched in fists of rage\nNo angel born in hell\nCould break that Satan\xe2\x80\x99s spell\nAnd as the flames climbed high into the night\nTo light the sacrificial rite\nI saw Satan laughing with delight\nThe day the music died\nWe were singing\nBye-bye Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry\nAnd them good old boys were drinking whiskey \'n rye\nSinging ""This\xe2\x80\x99ll be

store\nWhere I\xe2\x80\x99d heard the music years before\nBut the man there said the music wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t play\nAnd in the streets: the children screamed\nThe lovers cried and the poets dreamed\nBut not a word was spoken;\nThe church bells all were broken\nAnd the three men I admire most:\nThe father son and the holy ghost\nThey caught the last train for the coast\nThe day the music died\nAnd they were singing\nAnd there I stood alone and afraid\nI dropped to my knees and there I prayed\nAnd I promised him everything I could give\nIf only he would make the music live\nAnd he promised it would live once more\nBut this time one would equal four\nAnd in five years four had come to mourn\nAnd the music was reborn\nBye-bye Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry\nAnd them good old boys were drinking whiskey \'n rye\nSinging ""This\xe2\x80\x99ll be the day that I die\n""This\xe2\x80\x99ll be the day that I die.""\nThey were singing\nBye-bye Miss

65,Hurting Each Other,The Carpenters,1972,b'O black boy of Atlanta!\nBut half was spoken;\nThe slave\xe2\x80\x99s chains and the master\xe2\x80\x99s\nAlike are broken;\nThe one curse of the races\nHeld both in tether;\nThey are rising\xe2\x80\x94all are rising\xe2\x80\x94\nThe black and white together.\nWHITTIER.\nSOUTH of the North yet north of the South lies the City of a Hundred Hills peering out from the shadows of the past into the promise of the future. I have seen her in the morning when the first flush of day had half-roused her; she lay gray and still on the crimson soil of Georgia; then the blue smoke began to curl from her chimneys the tinkle of bell and scream of whistle broke the silence the rattle and roar of busy life slowly gathered and swelled until the seething whirl of the city seemed a strange thing in a sleepy land.\nOnce they say even Atlanta slept dull and drowsy at the foot-hills of the Alleghanies until the iron baptism of war awakened her with its sullen waters aroused and maddened her and left her listening to the sea. And the sea cried to the hills and the hills answered the sea till the city rose like a widow and cast away her weeds and toiled for her daily bread; toiled steadily toiled cunningly\xe2\x80\x94perhaps with some bitterness with a touch of r\xc3\xa9clame\xe2\x80\x94and yet with real earnestness and real sweat.\nIt is a hard thing to live haunted by the ghost of an untrue dream; to see the wide vision of empire fade into real ashes and dirt; to feel the pang of the conquered and yet know that with all the Bad that fell on one black day something was vanquished that deserved to live something killed that in justice had not dared to die; to know that with the Right that triumphed triumphed something of Wrong something sordid and mean something less than the broadest and best. All this is bitter hard; and many a man and city and people have found in it excuse for sulking and brooding and listless waiting.\nSuch are not men of the sturdier make; they of Atlanta turned resolutely toward the future; and that future held aloft vistas of purple and gold:\xe2\x80\x94Atlanta Queen of the cotton kingdom; Atlanta Gateway to the Land of the Sun; Atlanta the new Lachesis spinner of web and woof for the world. So the city crowned her hundred hills with factories and stored her shops with cunning handiwork and stretched long iron ways to greet the busy Mercury in his coming. And the Nation talked of her striving.\nPerhaps Atlanta was not christened for the winged maiden of dull Boeotia; you know the tale\xe2\x80\x94how swarthy Atalanta tall and wild would marry only him who out-raced her; and how the wily Hippomenes laid three apples of gold in the way. She fled like a shadow paused startled over the first apple but even as he stretched his hand fled again; hovered over the second then slipping from his hot grasp flew over river vale and hill; but as she lingered over the third his arms fell round her and looking on each other the blazing passion of their love profaned the sanctuary of Love and they were cursed. If Atlanta be not named for Atalanta she ought to have been.\nAtalanta is not the first or the last maiden whom greed of gold has led to defile the temple of Love; and not maids alone but men in the race of life sink from the high and generous ideals of youth to the gambler\xe2\x80\x99s code of the Bourse; and in all our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s striving is not the Gospel of Work befouled by the Gospel of Pay? So common is this that one-half think it normal; so unquestioned that we almost fear to question if the end of racing is not gold if the aim of man is not rightly to be rich. And if this is the fault of America how dire a danger lies before a new land and a new city lest Atlanta stooping for mere gold shall find that gold accursed!\nIt was no maiden\xe2\x80\x99s idle whim that started this hard racing; a fearful wilderness lay about the feet of that city after the War\xe2\x80\x94feudalism poverty the rise of the Third Estate serfdom the re-birth of Law and Order and above and between all the Veil of Race. How heavy a journey for weary feet! what wings must Atalanta have to flit over all this hollow and hill through sour wood and sullen water and by the red waste of sun-baked clay! How fleet must Atalanta be if she will not be tempted by gold to profane the Sanctuary!\nThe Sanctuary of our fathers has to be sure few Gods\xe2\x80\x94some sneer \xe2\x80\x9call too few.\xe2\x80\x9d There is the thrifty Mercury of New England Pluto of the North and Ceres of the West; and there too is the half-forgotten Apollo of the South under whose \xc3\xa6gis the maiden ran\xe2\x80\x94and as she ran she forgot him even as there in Boeotia Venus was forgot. She forgot the old ideal of the Southern gentleman\xe2\x80\x94that new-world heir of the grace and courtliness of patrician knight and noble; forgot his honor with his foibles his kindliness with his carelessness and stooped to apples of gold\xe2\x80\x94to men busier and sharper thriftier and more unscrupulous. Golden apples are beautiful\xe2\x80\x94I remember the lawless days of boyhood when orchards in crimson and gold tempted me over fence and field\xe2\x80\x94and too the merchant who has dethroned the planter is no despicable parvenu. Work and wealth are the mighty levers to lift this old new land; thrift and toil and saving are the highways to new hopes and new possibilities; and yet the warning is needed lest the wily Hippomenes tempt Atalanta to thinking that golden apples are the goal of racing and not mere incidents by the way.\nAtlanta must not lead the South to dream of material prosperity as the touchstone of all success; already the fatal might of this idea is beginning to spread; it is replacing the finer type of Southerner with vulgar money-getters; it is burying the sweeter beauties of Southern life beneath pretence and ostentation. For every social ill the panacea of Wealth has been urged\xe2\x80\x94wealth to overthrow the remains of the slave feudalism; wealth to raise the \xe2\x80\x9ccracker\xe2\x80\x9d Third Estate; wealth to employ the black serfs and the prospect of wealth to keep them working; wealth as the end and aim of politics and as the legal tender for law and order; and finally instead of Truth Beauty and Goodness wealth as the ideal of the Public School.\nNot only is this true in the world which Atlanta typifies but it is threatening to be true of a world beneath and beyond that world\xe2\x80\x94the Black World beyond the Veil. To-day it makes little difference to Atlanta to the South what the Negro thinks or dreams or wills. In the soul-life of the land he is to-day and naturally will long remain unthought of half forgotten; and yet when he does come to think and will and do for himself\xe2\x80\x94and let no man dream that day will never come\xe2\x80\x94then the part he plays will not be one of sudden learning but words and thoughts he has been taught to lisp in his race-childhood. To-day the ferment of his striving toward self-realization is to the strife of the white world like a wheel within a wheel: beyond the Veil are smaller but like problems of ideals of leaders and the led of serfdom of poverty of order and subordination and through all the Veil of Race. Few know of these problems few who know notice them; and yet there they are awaiting student artist and seer\xe2\x80\x94a field for somebody sometime to discover. Hither has the temptation of Hippomenes penetrated; already in this smaller world which now indirectly and anon directly must influence the larger for good or ill the habit is forming of interpreting the world in dollars. The old leaders of Negro opinion in the little groups where there is a Negro social consciousness are being replaced by new; neither the black preacher nor the black teacher leads as he did two decades ago. Into their places are pushing the farmers and gardeners the well-paid porters and artisans the businessmen\xe2\x80\x94all those with property and money. And with all this change so curiously parallel to that of the Other-world goes too the same inevitable change in ideals. The South laments to-day the slow steady disappearance of a certain type of Negro\xe2\x80\x94the faithful courteous slave of other days with his incorruptible honesty and dignified humility. He is passing away just as surely as the old type of Southern gentleman is passing and from not dissimilar causes\xe2\x80\x94the sudden transformation of a fair far-off ideal of Freedom into the hard reality of bread-winning and the consequent deification of Bread.\nIn the Black World the Preacher and Teacher embodied once the ideals of this people\xe2\x80\x94the strife for another and a juster world the vague dream of righteousness the mystery of knowing; but to-day the danger is that these ideals with their simple beauty and weird inspiration will suddenly sink to a question of cash and a lust for gold. Here stands this black young Atalanta girding herself for the race that must be run; and if her eyes be still toward the hills and sky as in the days of old then we may look for noble running; but what if some ruthless or wily or even thoughless Hippomenes lay golden apples before her? What if the Negro people be wooed from a strife for righteousness from a love of knowing to regard dollars as the be-all and end-all of life? What if to the Mammonism of America be added the rising Mammonism of the re-born South and the Mammonism of this South be reinforced by the budding Mammonism of its half-awakened black millions? Whither then is the new-world quest of Goodness and Beauty and Truth gone glimmering? Must this and that fair flower of Freedom which despite the jeers of latter-day striplings sprung from our fathers\xe2\x80\x99 blood must that too degenerate into a dusty quest of gold\xe2\x80\x94into lawless lust with Hippomenes?\nThe hundred hills of Atlanta are now all crowned with factories. On one toward the west the setting sun throws three buildings in bold relief against the sky. The beauty of the group lies in its simple unity:\xe2\x80\x94a broad lawn of green rising from the red street with mingled roses and peaches; north and south two plain and stately halls; and in the midst half hidden in ivy a larger building boldly graceful sparingly decorated and with one low spire. It is a restful group\xe2\x80\x94one never looks for more; it is all here all intelligible. There I live and there I hear from day to day the low hum of restful life. In winter\xe2\x80\x99s twilight when the red sun glows I can see the dark figures pass between the halls to the music of the night-bell. In the morning when the sun is golden the clang of the day-bell brings the hurry and laughter of three hundred young hearts from hall and street and from the busy city below\xe2\x80\x94children all dark and heavy-haired\xe2\x80\x94to join their clear young voices in the music of the morning sacrifice. In a half-dozen class-rooms they gather then\xe2\x80\x94here to follow the love-song of Dido here to listen to the tale of Troy divine; there to wander among the stars there to wander among men and nations\xe2\x80\x94and elsewhere other well-worn ways of knowing this queer world. Nothing new no time-saving devices\xe2\x80\x94simply old time-glorified methods of delving for Truth and searching out the hidden beauties of life and learning the good of living. The riddle of existence is the college curriculum that was laid before the Pharaohs that was taught in the groves by Plato that formed the trivium and quadrivium and is to-day laid before the freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s sons by Atlanta University. And this course of study will not change; its methods will grow more deft and effectual its content richer by toil of scholar and sight of seer; but the true college will ever have one goal\xe2\x80\x94not to earn meat but to know the end and aim of that life which meat nourishes.\nThe vision of life that rises before these dark eyes has in it nothing mean or selfish. Not at Oxford or at Leipsic not at Yale or Columbia is there an air of higher resolve or more unfettered striving; the determination to realize for men both black and white the broadest possibilities of life to seek the better and the best to spread with their own hands the Gospel of Sacrifice\xe2\x80\x94all this is the burden of their talk and dream. Here amid a wide desert of caste and proscription amid the heart-hurting slights and jars and vagaries of a deep race-dislike lies this green oasis where hot anger cools and the bitterness of disappointment is sweetened by the springs and breezes of Parnassus; and here men may lie and listen and learn of a future fuller than the past and hear the voice of Time:\n\xe2\x80\x9cEntbehren sollst du sollst entbehren.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThey made their mistakes those who planted Fisk and Howard and Atlanta before the smoke of battle had lifted; they made their mistakes but those mistakes were not the things at which we lately laughed somewhat uproariously. They were right when they sought to found a new educational system upon the University: where forsooth shall we ground knowledge save on the broadest and deepest knowledge? The roots of the tree rather than the leaves are the sources of its life; and from the dawn of history from Academus to Cambridge the culture of the University has been the broad foundation-stone on which is built the kindergarten\xe2\x80\x99s A B C.\nBut these builders did make a mistake in minimizing the gravity of the problem before them; in thinking it a matter of years and decades; in therefore building quickly and laying their foundation carelessly and lowering the standard of knowing until they had scattered haphazard through the South some dozen poorly equipped high schools and miscalled them universities. They forgot too just as their successors are forgetting the rule of inequality:\xe2\x80\x94that of the million black youth some were fitted to know and some to dig; that some had the talent and capacity of university men and some the talent and capacity of blacksmiths; and that true training meant neither that all should be college men nor all artisans but that the one should be made a missionary of culture to an untaught people and the other a free workman among serfs. And to seek to make the blacksmith a scholar is almost as silly as the more modern scheme of making the scholar a blacksmith; almost but not quite.\nThe function of the university is not simply to teach bread-winning or to furnish teachers for the public schools or to be a centre of polite society; it is above all to be the organ of that fine adjustment between real life and the growing knowledge of life an adjustment which forms the secret of civilization. Such an institution the South of to-day sorely needs. She has religion earnest bigoted:\xe2\x80\x94religion that on both sides the Veil often omits the sixth seventh and eighth commandments but substitutes a dozen supplementary ones. She has as Atlanta shows growing thrift and love of toil; but she lacks that broad knowledge of what the world knows and knew of human living and doing which she may apply to the thousand problems of real life to-day confronting her. The need of the South is knowledge and culture\xe2\x80\x94not in dainty limited quantity as before the war but in broad busy abundance in the world of work; and until she has this not all the Apples of Hesperides be they golden and bejewelled can save her from the curse of the Boeotian lovers.\nThe Wings of Atalanta are the coming universities of the South. They alone can bear the maiden past the temptation of golden fruit. They will not guide her flying feet away from the cotton and gold; for\xe2\x80\x94ah thoughtful Hippomenes!\xe2\x80\x94do not the apples lie in the very Way of Life? But they will guide her over and beyond them and leave her kneeling in the Sanctuary of Truth and Freedom and broad Humanity virgin and undefiled. Sadly did the Old South err in human education despising the education of the masses and niggardly in the support of colleges. Her ancient university foundations dwindled and withered under the foul breath of slavery; and even since the war they have fought a failing fight for life in the tainted air of social unrest and commercial selfishness stunted by the death of criticism and starving for lack of broadly cultured men. And if this is the white South\xe2\x80\x99s need and danger how much heavier the danger and need of the freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s sons! how pressing here the need of broad ideals and true culture the conservation of soul from sordid aims and petty passions! Let us build the Southern university\xe2\x80\x94William and Mary Trinity Georgia Texas Tulane Vanderbilt and the others\xe2\x80\x94fit to live; let us build too the Negro universities:\xe2\x80\x94Fisk whose foundation was ever broad; Howard at the heart of the Nation; Atlanta at Atlanta whose ideal of scholarship has been held above the temptation of numbers. Why not here and perhaps elsewhere plant deeply and for all time centres of learning and living colleges that yearly would send into the life of the South a few white men and a few black men of broad culture catholic tolerance and trained ability joining their hands to other hands and giving to this squabble of the Races a decent and dignified peace?\nPatience Humility Manners and Taste common schools and kindergartens industrial and technical schools literature and tolerance\xe2\x80\x94all these spring from knowledge and culture the children of the university. So must men and nations build not otherwise not upside down.\nTeach workers to work\xe2\x80\x94a wise saying; wise when applied to German boys and American girls; wiser when said of Negro boys for they have less knowledge of working and none to teach them. Teach thinkers to think\xe2\x80\x94a needed knowledge in a day of loose and careless logic; and they whose lot is gravest must have the carefulest training to think aright. If these things are so how foolish to ask what is the best education for one or seven or sixty million souls! shall we teach them trades or train them in liberal arts? Neither and both: teach the workers to work and the thinkers to think; make carpenters of carpenters and philosophers of philosophers and fops of fools. Nor can we pause here. We are training not isolated men but a living group of men\xe2\x80\x94nay a group within a group. And the final product of our training must be neither a psychologist nor a brickmason but a man. And to make men we must have ideals broad pure and inspiring ends of living\xe2\x80\x94not sordid money-getting not apples of gold. The worker must work for the glory of his handiwork not simply for pay; the thinker must think for truth not for fame. And all this is gained only by human strife and longing; by ceaseless training and education; by founding Right on righteousness and Truth on the unhampered search for Truth; by founding the common school on the university and the industrial school on the common school; and weaving thus a system not a distortion and bringing a birth not an abortion. 19\nWhen night falls on the City of a Hundred Hills a wind gathers itself from the seas and comes murmuring westward. And at its bidding the smoke of the drowsy factories sweeps down upon the mighty city and covers it like a pall while yonder at the University the stars twinkle above Stone Hall. And they say that yon gray mist is the tunic of Atalanta pausing over her golden apples. Fly my maiden fly for yonder comes Hippomenes!'

90,Day by Day,Original Cast of Godspell,1972,"b'\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the North Wall and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air his well-cut tweed suit and fearless accent. Few fellows had talents like his and fewer still could remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher\'s heart was in the right place and he had deserved to win. It was something to have a friend like that.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Little Chandler\'s thoughts ever since lunch-time had been of his meeting with Gallaher of Gallaher\'s invitation and of the great city London where Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because though he was but slightly under the average stature he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands were white and small his frame was fragile his voice was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish white teeth.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As he sat at his desk in the King\'s Inns he thought what changes those eight years had brought. The friend whom he had known under a shabby and necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the London Press. He turned often from his tiresome writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures\xe2\x80\x94on the children who ran screaming along the gravel paths and on everyone who passed through the gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life; and  he became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against fortune this being the burden of wisdom which the ages had bequeathed to him.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He remembered the books of poetry upon his shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor days and many an evening as he sat in the little room off the hall he had been tempted to take one down from the bookshelf and read out something to his wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so the books had remained on their shelves. At times he repeated lines to himself and this consoled him.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When his hour had struck he stood up and took leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal arch of the King\'s Inns a neat modest figure and walked swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. A horde of grimy children populated the street. They stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no thought. He picked his way deftly through all that minute vermin-like life and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered. No memory of the past touched him for his mind was full of a present joy.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He had never been in Corless\'s but he knew the value of the name. He knew that people went there after the theatre to eat oysters and drink liqueurs; and he had heard that the waiters there spoke French and German. Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn up before the door and richly dressed ladies escorted by cavaliers alight and enter quickly. They wore noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were powdered and they caught up their dresses when they touched earth like alarmed Atalantas. He had always passed without turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he found himself in the city late at night he hurried on his way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes however he courted the causes of his fear. He chose the darkest and narrowest streets and as he walked boldly forward the silence that was spread about his footsteps troubled him the wandering silent figures troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive laughter made him tremble like a leaf.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He turned to the right towards Capel Street. Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would have thought it possible eight years before? Still now that he reviewed the past Little Chandler could remember many signs of future greatness in his friend. People used to say that Ignatius Gallaher was wild. Of course he did mix with a rakish set of fellows at that time drank freely and borrowed money on all sides. In the end he had got mixed up in some shady affair some money transaction: at least that was one version of his flight. But nobody denied him talent. There was always a certain... something in Ignatius Gallaher that impressed you in spite of yourself. Even when he was out at elbows and at his wits\' end for money he kept up a bold face. Little Chandler remembered  one of Ignatius Gallaher\'s sayings when he was in a tight corner:\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Half time now boys"" he used to say light-heartedly. ""Where\'s my considering cap?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That was Ignatius Gallaher all out; and damn it you couldn\'t but admire him for it.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Little Chandler quickened his pace. For the first time in his life he felt himself superior to the people he passed. For the first time his soul revolted against the dull inelegance of Capel Street. There was no doubt about it: if you wanted to succeed you had to go away. You could do nothing in Dublin. As he crossed Grattan Bridge he looked down the river towards the lower quays and pitied the poor stunted houses. They seemed to him a band of tramps huddled together along the riverbanks their old coats covered with dust and soot stupefied by the panorama of sunset and waiting for the first chill of night bid them arise shake themselves and begone. He wondered whether he could write a poem to express his idea. Perhaps Gallaher might be able to get it into some London paper for him. Could he write something original? He was not sure what idea he wished to express but the thought that a poetic moment had touched him took life within him like an infant hope. He stepped onward bravely.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Every step brought him nearer to London farther from his own sober inartistic life. A light began to tremble on the horizon of his mind. He was not so old\xe2\x80\x94thirty-two. His temperament might be said to be just at the point of maturity. There were so many different moods and impressions that he wished to express in verse. He felt them within him. He tried to weigh his soul to see if it was a poet\'s soul. Melancholy was the dominant note of his temperament he thought but it was a melancholy tempered by recurrences of faith and resignation and simple joy. If he could give expression to it in a book of poems perhaps men would listen. He would never be popular: he saw that. He could not sway the crowd but he might appeal to a little circle of kindred minds. The English critics perhaps would recognise him as one of the Celtic school by reason of the melancholy tone of his poems; besides that he would put in allusions. He began to invent sentences and phrases from the notice which his book would get. ""Mr. Chandler has the gift of easy and graceful verse.""... ""wistful sadness pervades these poems.""... ""The Celtic note."" It was a pity his name was not more Irish-looking. Perhaps it would be better to insert his mother\'s name before the surname: Thomas Malone Chandler or better still: T. Malone Chandler. He would speak to Gallaher about it.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He pursued his revery so ardently that he passed his street and had to turn back. As he came near Corless\'s his former agitation began to overmaster him and he halted before the door in indecision. Finally he opened the door and entered.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The light and noise of the bar held him at the doorways for a few moments. He looked about him but his sight was confused by the shining of many red and green wine-glasses The bar seemed to him to be full of people and he felt that the people were observing him curiously. He glanced quickly to right and left  but when his sight cleared a little he saw that nobody had turned to look at him: and there sure enough was Ignatius Gallaher leaning with his back against the counter and his feet planted far apart.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Hallo Tommy old hero here you are! What is it to be? What will you have? I\'m taking whisky: better stuff than we get across the water. Soda? Lithia? No mineral? I\'m the same. Spoils the flavour.... Here garcon bring us two halves of malt whisky like a good fellow.... Well and how have you been pulling along since I saw you last? Dear God how old we\'re getting! Do you see any signs of aging in me\xe2\x80\x94eh what? A little grey and thin on the top\xe2\x80\x94what?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ignatius Gallaher took off his hat and displayed a large closely cropped head. His face was heavy pale and cleanshaven. His eyes which were of bluish slate-colour relieved his unhealthy pallor and shone out plainly above the vivid orange tie he wore. Between these rival features the lips appeared very long and shapeless and colourless. He bent his head and felt with two sympathetic fingers the thin hair at the crown. Little Chandler shook his head as a denial. Ignatius Galaher put on his hat again.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""It pulls you down"" he said. ""Press life. Always hurry and scurry looking for copy and sometimes not finding it: and then always to have something new in your stuff. Damn proofs and printers I say for a few days. I\'m deuced glad I can tell you to get back to the old country. Does a fellow good a bit of a holiday. I feel a ton better since I landed again in dear dirty Dublin.... Here you are Tommy. Water? Say when.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Little Chandler allowed his whisky to be very much diluted.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""You don\'t know what\'s good for you my boy"" said Ignatius Gallaher. ""I drink mine neat.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""I drink very little as a rule"" said Little Chandler modestly. ""An odd half-one or so when I meet any of the old crowd: that\'s all.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Ah well"" said Ignatius Gallaher cheerfully ""here\'s to us and to old times and old acquaintance.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0They clinked glasses and drank the toast.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""I met some of the old gang today"" said Ignatius Gallaher. ""O\'Hara seems to be in a bad way. What\'s he doing?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Nothing"" said Little Chandler. ""He\'s gone to the dogs.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""But Hogan has a good sit hasn\'t he?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Yes; he\'s in the Land Commission.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""I met him one night in London and he seemed to be very flush.... Poor O\'Hara! Boose I suppose?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Other things too"" said Little Chandler shortly.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ignatius Gallaher laughed.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Tommy"" he said ""I see you haven\'t changed an atom. You\'re the very same serious person that used to lecture me on Sunday mornings when I had a sore head and a fur on my tongue. You\'d want to knock about a bit in the world. Have you never been anywhere even for a trip?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""I\'ve been to the Isle of Man"" said Little Chandler.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ignatius Gallaher laughed.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""The Isle of Man!"" he said. ""Go to London or Paris: Paris for choice. That\'d do you good.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Have you seen Paris?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""I should think I have! I\'ve knocked about there a little.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""And is it really so beautiful as they say?"" asked Little Chandler.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He sipped a little of his drink while Ignatius Gallaher finished his boldly.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Beautiful?"" said Ignatius Gallaher pausing on the word and on the flavour of his drink. ""It\'s not so beautiful you know. Of course it is beautiful.... But it\'s the life of Paris; that\'s the thing. Ah there\'s no city like Paris for gaiety movement excitement....""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Little Chandler finished his whisky and after some trouble succeeded in catching the barman\'s eye. He ordered the same again.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""I\'ve been to the Moulin Rouge"" Ignatius Gallaher continued when the barman had removed their glasses ""and I\'ve been to all the Bohemian cafes. Hot stuff! Not for a pious chap like you Tommy.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Little Chandler said nothing until the barman returned with two glasses: then he touched his friend\'s glass lightly and reciprocated the former toast. He was beginning to feel somewhat disillusioned. Gallaher\'s accent and way of expressing himself did not please him. There was something vulgar in his friend which he had not observed before. But perhaps it was only the result of living in London amid the bustle and competition of the Press. The old personal charm was still there under this new gaudy manner. And after all Gallaher had lived he had seen the world. Little Chandler looked at his friend enviously.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Everything in Paris is gay"" said Ignatius Gallaher. ""They believe in enjoying life\xe2\x80\x94and don\'t you think they\'re right? If you want to enjoy yourself properly you must go to Paris. And mind you they\'ve a great feeling for the Irish there. When they heard I was from Ireland they were ready to eat me man.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Little Chandler took four or five sips from his glass.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Tell me"" he said ""is it true that Paris is so... immoral as they say?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ignatius Gallaher made a catholic gesture with his right arm.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Every place is immoral"" he said. ""Of course you do find spicy bits in Paris. Go to one of the students\' balls for instance. That\'s lively if you like when the cocottes begin to let themselves loose. You know what they are I suppose?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""I\'ve heard of them"" said Little Chandler.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ignatius Gallaher drank off his whisky and shook his head.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Ah"" he said ""you may say what you like. There\'s no woman like the Parisienne\xe2\x80\x94for style for go.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Then it is an immoral city"" said Little Chandler with timid insistence\xe2\x80\x94""I mean compared with London or Dublin?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""London!"" said Ignatius Gallaher. ""It\'s six of one and half-a-dozen of the other. You ask Hogan my boy. I showed him a bit about London when he was over there. He\'d open your eye.... I say Tommy don\'t make punch of that whisky: liquor up.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""No really....""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""O come on another one won\'t do you any harm. What is it? The same again I suppose?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Well... all right.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Francois the same again.... Will you smoke Tommy?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ignatius Gallaher produced his cigar-case. The two friends lit their cigars and puffed at them in silence until their drinks were served.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""I\'ll tell you my opinion"" said Ignatius Gallaher emerging after some time from the clouds of smoke in which he had taken refuge ""it\'s a rum world. Talk of immorality! I\'ve heard of cases\xe2\x80\x94what am I saying?\xe2\x80\x94I\'ve known them: cases of... immorality....""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ignatius Gallaher puffed thoughtfully at his cigar and then in a calm historian\'s tone he proceeded to sketch for his friend some pictures of the corruption which was rife abroad. He summarised the vices of many capitals and seemed inclined to award the palm to Berlin. Some things he could not vouch for  but of others he had had personal experience. He spared neither rank nor caste. He revealed many of the secrets of religious houses on the Continent and described some of the practices which were fashionable in high society and ended by telling with details a story about an English duchess\xe2\x80\x94a story which he knew to be true. Little Chandler was astonished.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Ah well"" said Ignatius Gallaher ""here we are in old jog-along Dublin where nothing is known of such things.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""How dull you must find it"" said Little Chandler ""after all the other places you\'ve seen!""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Well"" said Ignatius Gallaher ""it\'s a relaxation to come over here you know. And after all it\'s the old country as they say isn\'t it? You can\'t help having a certain feeling for it. That\'s human nature.... But tell me something about yourself. Hogan told me you had... tasted the joys of connubial bliss. Two years ago wasn\'t it?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Little Chandler blushed and smiled.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Yes"" he said. ""I was married last May twelve months.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""I hope it\'s not too late in the day to offer my best wishes"" said Ignatius Gallaher. ""I didn\'t know your address or I\'d have done so at the time.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He extended his hand which Little Chandler took.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Well Tommy"" he said ""I wish you and yours every joy in life old chap and tons of money and may you never die till I shoot you. And that\'s the wish of a sincere friend an old friend. You know that?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""I know that"" said Little Chandler.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Any youngsters?"" said Ignatius Gallaher.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Little Chandler blushed again.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""We have one child"" he said.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Son or daughter?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""A little boy.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ignatius Gallaher slapped his friend sonorously on the back.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Bravo"" he said ""I wouldn\'t doubt you Tommy.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Little Chandler smiled looked confusedly at his glass and bit his lower lip with three childishly white front teeth.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""I hope you\'ll spend an evening with us"" he said ""before you go back. My wife will be delighted to meet you. We can have a little music and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Thanks awfully old chap"" said Ignatius Gallaher ""I\'m sorry we didn\'t meet earlier. But I must leave tomorrow night.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Tonight perhaps...?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""I\'m awfully sorry old man. You see I\'m over here with another fellow clever young chap he is too and we arranged to go to a little card-party. Only for that...""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""O in that case...""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""But who knows?"" said Ignatius Gallaher considerately. ""Next year I may take a little skip over here now that I\'ve broken the ice. It\'s only a pleasure deferred.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Very well"" said Little Chandler ""the next time you come we must have an evening together. That\'s agreed now isn\'t it?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Yes that\'s agreed"" said Ignatius Gallaher. ""Next year if I come parole d\'honneur.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""And to clinch the bargain"" said Little Chandler ""we\'ll just have one more now.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ignatius Gallaher took out a large gold watch and looked at it.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Is it to be the last?"" he said. ""Because you know I have an a.p.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""O yes positively"" said Little Chandler.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Very well then"" said Ignatius Gallaher ""let us have another one as a deoc an doruis\xe2\x80\x94that\'s good vernacular for a small whisky I believe.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Little Chandler ordered the drinks. The blush which had risen to his face a few moments before was establishing itself. A trifle made him blush at any time: and now he felt warm and excited. Three small whiskies had gone to his head and Gallaher\'s strong cigar had confused his mind for he was a delicate and abstinent person. The adventure of meeting Gallaher after eight years of finding himself with Gallaher in Corless\'s surrounded by lights and noise of listening to Gallaher\'s stories and of sharing for a brief space Gallaher\'s vagrant and triumphant life upset the equipoise of his sensitive nature. He felt acutely the contrast between his own life and his friend\'s and it seemed to him unjust. Gallaher was his inferior in birth and education. He was sure that he could do something better than his friend had ever done or could ever do something higher than mere tawdry journalism if he only got the chance. What was it that stood in his way? His unfortunate timidity! He wished to vindicate himself in some way to assert his manhood. He saw behind Gallaher\'s refusal of his invitation. Gallaher was only patronising him by his friendliness just as he was patronising Ireland by his visit.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The barman brought their drinks. Little Chandler pushed one glass towards his friend and took up the other boldly.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Who knows?"" he said as they lifted their glasses. ""When you come next year I may have the pleasure of wishing long life and happiness to Mr. and Mrs. Ignatius Gallaher.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ignatius Gallaher in the act of drinking closed one eye expressively over the rim of his glass. When he had drunk he smacked his lips decisively set down his glass and said:\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""No blooming fear of that my boy. I\'m going to have my fling first and see a bit of life and the world before I put my head in the sack\xe2\x80\x94if I ever do.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Someday you will"" said Little Chandler calmly.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ignatius Gallaher turned his orange tie and slate-blue eyes full upon his friend.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""You think so?"" he said.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""You\'ll put your head in the sack"" repeated Little Chandler stoutly ""like everyone else if you can find the girl.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He had slightly emphasised his tone and he was aware that he had betrayed himself; but though the colour had heightened in his cheek he did not flinch from his friend\'s gaze. Ignatius Gallaher watched him for a few moments and then said:\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""If ever it occurs you may bet your bottom dollar there\'ll be no mooning and spooning about it. I mean to marry money. She\'ll have a good fat account at the bank or she won\'t do for me.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Little Chandler shook his head.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Why man alive"" said Ignatius Gallaher vehemently ""do you know what it is? I\'ve only to say the word and tomorrow I can have the woman and the cash. You don\'t believe it? Well I know it. There are hundreds\xe2\x80\x94what am I saying?\xe2\x80\x94thousands of rich Germans and Jews rotten with money that\'d only be too glad.... You wait a while my boy. See if I don\'t play my cards properly. When I go about a thing I mean business I tell you. You just wait.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He tossed his glass to his mouth finished his drink and laughed loudly. Then he looked thoughtfully before him and said in a calmer tone:\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""But I\'m in no hurry. They can wait. I don\'t fancy tying myself up to one woman you know.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He imitated with his mouth the act of tasting and made a wry face.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Must get a bit stale I should think"" he said.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Little Chandler sat in the room off the hall holding a child in his arms. To save money they kept no servant but Annie\'s young sister Monica came for an hour or so in the morning and an hour or so in the evening to help. But Monica had gone home long ago. It was a quarter to nine. Little Chandler had come home late for tea and moreover he had forgotten to bring Annie home the parcel of coffee from Bewley\'s. Of course she was in a bad humour and gave him short answers. She said she would do without any tea but when it came near the time at which the shop at the corner closed she decided to go out herself for a quarter of a pound of tea and two pounds of sugar. She put the sleeping child deftly in his arms and said:\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Here. Don\'t waken him.""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A little lamp with a white china shade stood upon the table and its light fell over a photograph which was enclosed in a frame of crumpled horn. It was Annie\'s photograph. Little Chandler looked at it pausing at the thin tight lips. She wore the pale blue summer blouse which he had brought her home as a present one Saturday. It had cost him ten and elevenpence; but what an agony of nervousness it had cost him! How he had suffered that day waiting at the shop door until the shop was empty standing at the counter and trying to appear at his ease while the girl piled ladies\' blouses before him paying at the desk and forgetting to take up the odd penny of his change being called back by the cashier and finally striving to hide his blushes as he left the shop by examining the parcel to see if it was securely tied. When he brought the blouse home Annie kissed him and said it was very pretty and stylish; but when she heard the price she threw the blouse on the table and said it was a regular swindle to charge ten and elevenpence for it. At first she wanted to take it back but when she tried it on she was delighted with it especially with the make of the sleeves and kissed him and said he was very good to think of her.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hm!...\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He looked coldly into the eyes of the photograph and they answered coldly. Certainly they were pretty and the face itself was pretty. But he found something mean in it. Why was it so unconscious and ladylike? The composure of the eyes irritated him. They repelled him and defied him: there was no passion in them no rapture. He thought of what Gallaher had said about rich Jewesses. Those dark Oriental eyes he thought how full they are of passion of voluptuous longing!... Why had he married the eyes in the photograph?\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He caught himself up at the question and glanced nervously round the room. He found something mean in the pretty furniture which he had bought for his house on the hire system. Annie had chosen it herself and it reminded him of her. It too was prim and pretty. A dull resentment against his life awoke within him. Could he not escape from his little house? Was it too late for him to try to live bravely like Gallaher? Could he go to London? There was the furniture still to be paid for. If he could only write a book and get it published that might open the way for him.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A volume of Byron\'s poems lay before him on the table. He opened it cautiously with his left hand lest he should waken the child and began to read the first poem in the book:\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hushed are the winds and still the evening gloom\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Not e\'en a Zephyr wanders through the grove\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Whilst I return to view my Margaret\'s tomb\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And scatter flowers on the dust I love.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He paused. He felt the rhythm of the verse about him in the room. How melancholy it was! Could he too write like that express the melancholy of his soul in verse? There were so many things he wanted to describe: his sensation of a few hours before on Grattan Bridge for example. If he could get back again into that mood....\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The child awoke and began to cry. He turned from the page and tried to hush it: but it would not be hushed. He began to rock it to and fro in his arms but its wailing cry grew keener. He rocked it faster while his eyes began to read the second stanza:\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Within this narrow cell reclines her clay\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That clay where once...\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It was useless. He couldn\'t read. He couldn\'t do anything. The wailing of the child pierced the drum of his ear. It was useless useless! He was a prisoner for life. His arms trembled with anger and suddenly bending to the child\'s face he shouted:\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""Stop!""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The child stopped for an instant had a spasm of fright and began to scream. He jumped up from his chair and walked hastily up and down the room with the child in his arms. It began to sob piteously losing its breath for four or five seconds and then bursting out anew. The thin walls of the room echoed the sound. He tried to soothe it but it sobbed more convulsively. He looked at the contracted and quivering face of the child and began to be alarmed. He counted seven sobs without a break between them and caught the child to his breast in fright. If it died!...\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The door was burst open and a young woman ran in panting.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""What is it? What is it?"" she cried.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The child hearing its mother\'s voice broke out into a paroxysm of sobbing.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""It\'s nothing Annie... it\'s nothing.... He began to cry...""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0She flung her parcels on the floor and snatched the child from him.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""What have you done to him?"" she cried glaring into his face.\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Little Chandler sustained for one moment the gaze of her eyes and his heart closed together as he met the hatred in them. He began to stammer:\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""It\'s nothing.... He... he began to cry.... I couldn\'t... I didn\'t do anything.... What?""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Giving no heed to him she began to walk up and down the room clasping the child tightly in her arms and murmuring:\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0""My little man! My little mannie! Was \'ou frightened love?... There now love! There now!... Lambabaun! Mamma\'s little lamb of the world!... There now!""\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Little Chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back out of the lamplight. He listened while the paroxysm of the child\'s sobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to his eyes.'"
