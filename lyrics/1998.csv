50,I Will Come to You,Hanson,1998,b'This came out so straight that he saw at once how much truth it expressed yet it was truth that still a little puzzled him But did you ever like knocking about in such discomfort It seems to me now that I then liked everything It s the charm at any rate she said from her place at the fire of trying again the old feelings They come back they come back Everything she went on comes back Besides she wound up you know for yourself He stood near her his hands in his pockets but not looking at her looking hard at the tea table Ah I haven t your courage Moreover he laughed it seems to me that so far as that goes I do live in hansoms But you must awfully want your tea he quickly added so let me give you a good stiff cup He busied himself with this care and she sat down on his pushing up a low seat where she had been standing so that while she talked he could bring her what she further desired He moved to and fro before her he helped himself and her visit as the moments passed had more and more the effect of a signal communication that she had come all responsibly and deliberately as on the clear show of the clock face of their situation to make The whole demonstration none the less presented itself as taking place at a very high level of debate in the cool upper air of the finer discrimination the deeper sincerity the larger philosophy No matter what were the facts invoked and arrayed it was only a question as yet of their seeing their way together to which indeed exactly the present occasion appeared to have so much to contribute It s not that you haven t my courage Charlotte said but that you haven t I rather think my imagination Unless indeed it should turn out after all she added that you haven t even my intelligence However I shall not be afraid of that till you ve given me more proof And she made again but more clearly her point of a moment before You knew besides you knew to day I would come And if you knew that you know everything So she pursued and if he didn t meanwhile if he didn t even at this take her up it might be that she was so positively fitting him again with the fair face of temporising kindness that he had given her to keep her eyes on at the other important juncture and the sense of which she might ever since have been carrying about with her like a precious medal not exactly blessed by the Pope suspended round her neck She had come back however this might be to her immediate account of herself and no mention of their great previous passage was to rise to the lips of either Above all she said there has been the personal romance of it Of tea with me over the fire Ah so far as that goes I don t think even my intelligence fails me Oh it s further than that goes and if I ve had a better day than you it s perhaps when I come to think of it that I AM braver You bore yourself you see But I don t I don t I don t she repeated It s precisely boring one s self without relief he protested that takes courage Passive then not active My romance is that if you want to know I ve been all day on the town Literally on the town isn t that what they call it I know how it feels After which as if breaking off And you have you never been out she asked He still stood there with his hands in his pockets What should I have gone out for Oh what should people in our case do anything for But you re wonderful all of YOU you know how to live We re clumsy brutes we other s beside you we must always be doing something However Charlotte pursued if you had gone out you might have missed the chance of me which I m sure though you won t confess it was what you didn t want and might have missed above all the satisfaction that look blank about it as you will I ve come to congratulate you on That s really what I can at last do You can t not know at least on such a day as this you can t not know she said where you are She waited as for him either to grant that he knew or to pretend that he didn t but he only drew a long deep breath which came out like a moan of impatience It brushed aside the question of where he was or what he knew it seemed to keep the ground clear for the question of his visitor herself that of Charlotte Verver exactly as she sat there So for some moments with their long look they but treated the matter in silence with the effect indeed by the end of the time of having considerably brought it on This was sufficiently marked in what Charlotte next said There it all is extraordinary beyond words It makes such a relation for us as I verily believe was never before in the world thrust upon two well meaning creatures Haven t we therefore to take things as we find them She put the question still more directly than that of a moment before but to this one as well he returned no immediate answer Noticing only that she had finished her tea he relieved her of her cup carried it back to the table asked her what more she would have and then on her Nothing thanks returned to the fire and restored a displaced log to position by a small but almost too effectual kick She had meanwhile got up again and it was on her feet that she repeated the words she had first frankly spoken What else can we do what in all the world else He took them up however no more than at first Where then have you been he asked as from mere interest in her adventure Everywhere I could think of except to see people I didn t want people I wanted too much to think But I ve been back at intervals three times and then come away again My cabman must think me crazy it s very amusing I shall owe him when we come to settle more money than he has ever seen I ve been my dear she went on to the British Museum which you know I always adore And I ve been to the National Gallery and to a dozen old booksellers coming across treasures and I ve lunched on some strange nastiness at a cookshop in Holborn I wanted to go to the Tower but it was too far my old man urged that and I would have gone to the Zoo if it hadn t been too wet which he also begged me to observe But you wouldn t believe I did put in St Paul s Such days she wound up are expensive for besides the cab I ve bought quantities of books She immediately passed at any rate to another point I can t help wondering when you must last have laid eyes on them And then as it had apparently for her companion an effect of abruptness Maggie I mean and the child For I suppose you know he s with her Oh yes I know he s with her I saw them this morning And did they then announce their programme She told me she was taking him as usual da nonno And for the whole day He hesitated but it was as if his attitude had slowly shifted She didn t say And I didn t ask Well she went on it can t have been later than half past ten I mean when you saw them They had got to Eaton Square before eleven You know we don t formally breakfast Adam and I we have tea in our rooms at least I have but luncheon is early and I saw my husband this morning by twelve he was showing the child a picture book Maggie had been there with them had left them settled together Then she had gone out taking the carriage for something he had been intending but that she offered to do instead The Prince appeared to confess at this to his interest Taking you mean YOUR carriage I don t know which and it doesn t matter It s not a question she smiled of a carriage the more or the less It s not a question even if you come to that of a cab It s so beautiful she said that it s not a question of anything vulgar or horrid Which she gave him time to agree about and though he was silent it was rather remarkably as if he fell in I went out I wanted to I had my idea It seemed to me important It has BEEN it IS important I know as I haven t known before the way they feel I couldn t in any other way have made so sure of it They feel a confidence the Prince observed He had indeed said it for her They feel a confidence And she proceeded with lucidity to the fuller illustration of it speaking again of the three different moments that in the course of her wild ramble had witnessed her return for curiosity and even really a little from anxiety to Eaton Square She was possessed of a latch key rarely used it had always irritated Adam one of the few things that did to find servants standing up so inhumanly straight when they came home in the small hours after parties So I had but to slip in each time with my cab at the door and make out for myself without their knowing it that Maggie was still there I came I went without their so much as dreaming What do they really suppose she asked becomes of one not so much sentimentally or morally so to call it and since that doesn t matter but even just physically materially as a mere wandering woman as a decent harmless wife after all as the best stepmother after all that really ever was or at the least simply as a maitresse de maison not quite without a conscience They must even in their odd way she declared have SOME idea Oh they ve a great deal of idea said the Prince And nothing was easier than to mention the quantity They think so much of us They think in particular so much of you Ah don t put it all on me she smiled But he was putting it now where she had admirably prepared the place It s a matter of your known character Ah thank you for known she still smiled It s a matter of your wonderful cleverness and wonderful charm It s a matter of what those things have done for you in the world I mean in THIS world and this place You re a Personage for them and Personages do go and come Oh no my dear there you re quite wrong And she laughed now in the happier light they had diffused That s exactly what Personages don t do they live in state and under constant consideration they haven t latch keys but drums and trumpets announce them and when they go out in growlers it makes a greater noise still It s you caro mio she said who so far as that goes are the Personage Ah he in turn protested don t put it all on me What at any rate when you get home he added shall you say that you ve been doing I shall say beautifully that I ve been here All day Yes all day Keeping you company in your solitude How can we understand anything she went on without really seeing that this is what they must like to think I do for you just as quite as comfortably you do it for me The thing is for us to learn to take them as they are He considered this a while in his restless way but with his eyes not turning from her after which rather disconnectedly though very vehemently he brought out How can I not feel more than anything else how they adore together my boy And then further as if slightly disconcerted she had nothing to meet this and he quickly perceived the effect They would have done the same for one of yours Ah if I could have had one I hoped and I believed said Charlotte that that would happen It would have been better It would have made perhaps some difference He thought so too poor duck that it might have been I m sure he hoped and intended so It s not at any rate she went on my fault There it is She had uttered these statements one by one gravely sadly and responsibly owing it to her friend to be clear She paused briefly but as if once for all she made her clearness complete And now I m too sure It will never be He waited for a moment Never Never They treated the matter not exactly with solemnity but with a certain decency even perhaps urgency of distinctness It would probably have been better Charlotte added But things turn out And it leaves us she made the point more alone He seemed to wonder It leaves you more alone Oh she again returned don t put it all on me Maggie would have given herself to his child I m sure scarcely less than he gives himself to yours It would have taken more than any child of mine she explained it would have taken more than ten children of mine could I have had them to keep our sposi apart She smiled as for the breadth of the image but as he seemed to take it in spite of this for important she then spoke gravely enough It s as strange as you like but we re immensely alone He kept vaguely moving but there were moments when again with an awkward ease and his hands in his pockets he was more directly before her He stood there at these last words which had the effect of making him for a little throw back his head and as thinking something out stare up at the ceiling What will you say she meanwhile asked that you ve been doing This brought his consciousness and his eyes back to her and she pointed her question I mean when she comes in for I suppose she WILL some time come in It seems to me we must say the same thing Well he thought again Yet I can scarce pretend to have had what I haven t Ah WHAT haven t you had what aren t you having Her question rang out as they lingered face to face and he still took it before he answered from her eyes We must at least then not to be absurd together do the same thing We must act it would really seem in concert It would really seem Her eyebrows her shoulders went up quite in gaiety as for the relief this brought her It s all in the world I pretend We must act in concert Heaven knows she said THEY do So it was that he evidently saw and that by his admission the case could fairly be put But what he evidently saw appeared to come over him at the same time as too much for him so that he fell back suddenly to ground where she was not awaiting him The difficulty is and will always be that I don t understand them I didn t at first but I thought I should learn to That was what I hoped and it appeared then that Fanny Assingham might help me Oh Fanny Assingham said Charlotte Verver He stared a moment at her tone She would do anything for us To which Charlotte at first said nothing as if from the sense of too much Then indulgently enough she shook her head We re beyond her He thought a moment as of where this placed them She d do anything then for THEM Well so would we so that doesn t help us She has broken down She doesn t understand us And really my dear Charlotte added Fanny Assingham doesn t matter He wondered again Unless as taking care of THEM Ah Charlotte instantly said isn t it for us only to do that She spoke as with a flare of pride for their privilege and their duty I think we want no one s aid She spoke indeed with a nobleness not the less effective for coming in so oddly with a sincerity visible even through the complicated twist by which any effort to protect the father and the daughter seemed necessarily conditioned for them It moved him in any case as if some spring of his own a weaker one had suddenly been broken by it These things all the while the privilege the duty the opportunity had been the substance of his own vision they formed the note he had been keeping back to show her that he was not in their so special situation without a responsible view A conception that he could name and could act on was something that now at last not to be too eminent a fool he was required by all the graces to produce and the luminous idea she had herself uttered would have been his expression of it She had anticipated him but as her expression left for positive beauty nothing to be desired he felt rather righted than wronged A large response as he looked at her came into his face a light of excited perception all his own in the glory of which as it almost might be called what he gave her back had the value of what she had given him They re extraordinarily happy Oh Charlotte s measure of it was only too full Beatifically That s the great thing he went on so that it doesn t matter really that one doesn t understand Besides you do enough I understand my husband perhaps she after an instant conceded I don t understand your wife You re of the same race at any rate more or less of the same general tradition and education of the same moral paste There are things you have in common with them But I on my side as I ve gone on trying to see if I haven t some of these things too I on my side have more and more failed There seem at last to be none worth mentioning I can t help seeing it I m decidedly too different Yet you re not Charlotte made the important point too different from ME I don t know as we re not married That brings things out Perhaps if we were he said you WOULD find some abyss of divergence Since it depends on that then she smiled I m safe as you are anyhow Moreover as one has so often had occasion to feel and even to remark they re very very simple That makes she added a difficulty for belief but when once one has taken it in it makes less difficulty for action I HAVE at last for myself I think taken it in I m not afraid He wondered a moment Not afraid of what Well generally of some beastly mistake Especially of any mistake founded on one s idea of their difference For that idea Charlotte developed positively makes one so tender Ah but rather Well then there it is I can t put myself into Maggie s skin I can t as I say It s not my fit I shouldn t be able as I see it to breathe in it But I can feel that I d do anything to shield it from a bruise Tender as I am for her too she went on I think I m still more so for my husband HE S in truth of a sweet simplicity The Prince turned over a while the sweet simplicity of Mr Verver Well I don t know that I can choose At night all cats are grey I only see how for so many reasons we ought to stand toward them and how to do ourselves justice we do It represents for us a conscious care Of every hour literally said Charlotte She could rise to the highest measure of the facts And for which we must trust each other Oh as we trust the saints in glory Fortunately the Prince hastened to add we can With which as for the full assurance and the pledge it involved their hands instinctively found their hands It s all too wonderful Firmly and gravely she kept his hand It s too beautiful And so for a minute they stood together as strongly held and as closely confronted as any hour of their easier past even had seen them They were silent at first only facing and faced only grasping and grasped only meeting and met It s sacred he said at last It s sacred she breathed back to him They vowed it gave it out and took it in drawn by their intensity more closely together Then of a sudden through this tightened circle as at the issue of a narrow strait into the sea beyond everything broke up broke down gave way melted and mingled Their lips sought their lips their pressure their response and their response their pressure with a violence that had sighed itself the next moment to the longest and deepest of stillnesses they passionately sealed their pledge '
