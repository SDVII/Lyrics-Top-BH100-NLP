2,"Waterfalls",TLC,1995,b' A lonely mother gazing out of the window Staring at a son that she just can t touch If at any time he s in a jam she ll be by his side But he doesn t realize he hurts her so much But all the praying just ain t helping at all Cause he can t seem to keep his self out of trouble So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how Another body laying cold in the gutter Listen to me Don t go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you re used to I know that you re gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you re moving too fast Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation But he just can t see She gives him loving that his body can t handle But all he can say is Baby it s good to me One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror But he doesn t recognize his own face His health is fading and he doesn t know why Three letters took him to his final resting place Y all don t hear me Don t go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you re used to I know that you re gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you re moving too fast Don t go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you re used to I know that you re gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you re moving too fast Come on I seen a rainbow yesterday but too many storms Have come and gone leaving a trace of not one God given ray Is it because my life is ten shades of gray I pray All ten fade away seldom praise Him for the sunny days And like His promise is true only my faith can undo The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew Clear and blue and unconditional skies Have dried the tears from my eyes no more lonely cries My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can t cope With such an endurin pain that it keeps em in the pourin rain Who s to blame for tooting caine into your own vein What a shame you shoot and aim for someone else s brain You claim the insane and name this day in time For falling prey to crime I say the system s got you victim to your own mind Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true Believe in yourself the rest is up to me and you Don t go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you re used to I know that you re gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you re moving too fast Don t go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you re used to I know that you re gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you re moving too fast'
