2,"Bleeding Love",Leona Lewis,2008,b' Closed off from love I didn t need the pain Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain Time starts to pass before you know it you re frozen But something happened for the very first time with you My heart melted to the ground Found something true And everyone s looking round thinking I m going crazy But I don t care what they say I m in love with you They try to pull me away but they don t know the truth My heart s crippled by the vein that I keep on closing You cut me open and I Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love You cut me open Trying hard not to hear but they talk so loud Their piercing sounds fill my ears try to fill me with doubt Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling But nothing s greater than the risk That comes with your embrace And in this world of loneliness I see your face Yet everyone around me thinks that I m going crazy Maybe maybe But I don t care what they say I m in love with you They try to pull me away but they don t know the truth My heart s crippled by the vein that I keep on closing You cut me open and I Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love You cut me open And it s draining all of me Though they find it hard to believe I ll be wearing these scars for everyone to see But I don t care what they say I m in love with you They try to pull me away but they don t know the truth My heart s crippled by the vein that I keep on closing You cut me open and I Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love Ooh you cut me open and I Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love'
