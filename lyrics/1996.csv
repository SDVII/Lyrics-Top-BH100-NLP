9,"You're Makin' Me High / ""Let It Flow""",Toni Braxton,1996,b'Often when discussing the elite pack of divas who ruled the 90s and early aughts Toni Braxton is cast aside This shouldn t be the case there s way more to her story than Un Break My Heart Known for her sultry low ranging contralto voice Braxton who turns 50 this Saturday Oct 7 provided the R B pop and adult contemporary hemispheres with a slew of signature classics The dramatic flare of these songs matched with her film noir aesthetic and style convincingly sold Braxton s extensive discography centered on the raging emotions of love and heartbreak The smoothness and mature sophistication in her sound offered a lighter shading to the early waves of hip hop soul and alternative R B that reigned supreme in the 90s Well into the early aughts Braxton would find herself pairing quiet storm vibes with hip hop undertones After an unfortunate dip in mainstream appeal maligned by label issues and personal matters in the mid 00 s Braxton regained her place in the spotlight with a Dancing With The Stars stint a successful reality TV show alongside her sisters and a critically acclaimed reunion album with her mentor Kenneth Babyface Edmonds Now the legend prepares to release her ninth studio album slated to be released next year including her current single Deadwood To celebrate the songstress milestone birthday Billboard ranks the 25 best Toni Braxton songs including singles and deep cuts 25 You Mean The World To Me After departing from her all sisters quintet The Braxtons the eldest of the girl group embarked on a successful solo career 1993 saw the arrival of Toni Braxton a self titled debut that topped both the Billboard 200 and R B Albums charts for multiple weeks As the fourth lead single on the LP You Mean The World reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1994 thanks to the soulful swing of the hook dedicated to a cherished lover 24 Why Should I Care Following up her debut with Secrets Braxton reinvigorated the sound and format of quiet storm with arguably her best album to date Full of ballads centered on dealing with an unfaithful soulmate Secrets cemented the legacy of Braxton s signature blend of mature R B with breezy adult contemporary In this deep cut the crooner questions why she should care about said partner over a psychedelic guitar riff and synth reminiscent of The Isley Brothers 23 Spanish Guitar Most legends can t say that their international single became a soundtrack staple for a Brazilian soap opera La os de Fam lia would help Braxton s Latin pop ballad become a mass success in its home country and ultimately a primary example of Latin music s influence on mainstream culture 22 The Heat Spanish Guitar aptly oozed a sweltering mystique fitting enough for Braxton s third studio album The Heat Also incorporating that magic is the album s title track a subtle jaunt working in the sounds of a tropical summer and a light jazzy groove No wonder why the ending question is does anyone want some ice cream 21 Hit The Freeway feat Loon Entering the new millennium Braxton gained more artistic control from LaFace She also felt a need to strip away some of her balladry and embrace her love of hip hop la Mariah Carey s Butterfly Braxton s first LPs of the aughts The Heat and More Than A Woman also embraced a sexier borderline controversial side of the songstress As the lone single from More Than A Woman Freeway joins a list of notable bangers produced by Pharrell s launching pad The Neptunes And thanks to its Loon co sign it also has a Bad Boys Records stamp of approval 20 Trippin After leaving LaFace Records in 2003 Braxton signed to the record label abyss known as Blackground Records If you re familiar with the label s nightmare stories revolving around Aaliyah and JoJo it goes without saying that Braxton s first album under the label Libra didn t fare well commercially That being said the LP contains the singer s peak unreleased singles and barely existent promos The highlight of this particular cut A comparison of spousal conflict with 12 rounds up inside the Garden 19 Talking In His Sleep Can you keep a secret asks the diva throughout the epicenter track of Secrets Here she s confronted by her adulterous lover who accidentally spills his dirty laundry while snoozing Afflicted by a 70s noir jazz riff Talking takes a page from Madonna s Justify My Love balancing a scandalous spoken word narrative with a seductive hook 18 Yesterday feat Trey Songz It d take five years after Libra and a release from Blackground Records for Braxton to deliver her next studio album Serving as the first single from Pulse the singer gets over her ex by labeling him a day of the past Yesterday served as a testament to how Braxton manages to maintain her signature blend of genre formats years after her higher charting moments 17 Hurt You feat Babyface When Braxton started her singing career in 1989 Babyface became an integral component of her artistry After going through separate divorces the duo partnered up for the Grammy winning concept album Love Marriage and Divorce featuring this apology ballad that topped the Adult R B Songs chart 16 Midnite This cut from Libra perfectly captures Braxton s ability to cruise along with the stripped melodic structuring of her songs Her ad libs and riffs shine throughout Midnite making it a pleasant earworm in her deeper catalogue 15 Love Shoulda Brought You Home Although Give U My Heart a duet with Babyface is credited as Braxton s official single debut Love receives the honor of her first solo effort Both songs appeared on the Eddie Murphy rom com Boomerang but Love would be regarded as the favorite thanks to Braxton s powerhouse vocal control and dexterity 14 How Many Ways Released as a single in 1994 How Many Ways adequately reflects the finalization of new jack swing and the emerging popularity of its brethren hip hop soul The soulful declaration co written and produced by Tamar s future husband Vincent Hubert sees Braxton recounting various ways she loves her man The single served opposite to its double A side the Whitney Houston esque I Belong To You 13 Seven Whole Days Regarded as one of Braxton s iconic singles the songstress recalls not knowing her lover s whereabouts for more than a week Written and produced by her dream team of Babyface and Darryl Simmons Braxton s runs are what impressed listeners the most She would later revisit the song s idea slyly mentioning going seven whole days without hearing from you on Finally Libra s semi mash up of her most famous lyrics 12 Just Be A Man About It Since The Heat was meant to embrace the more progressive sounds of contemporary R B Braxton also incorporated a little electro hop on the album s second single With the support of a stormy atmosphere and womanizing voicemail delivered by Dr Dre the singer s hurt vocals shine in yet another convincing performance 11 There s No Me Without You This deep cut earnestly emotes despair and a feeling of defeat after a break up Helped by backing vocals of the songwriter Babyface this Toni Braxton song s hook glides with a country twang the singer adopting the vocal patterns of the genre with a pristine R B palette 10 Take This Ring Imma let you finish Beyonc but Toni Braxton had one of the best Single Ladies of all time Three years before we d receive an official dance and a Spandex driven anthem from Bey Braxton released a club banger echoing a similar sentiment Fortified by a rocking go go beat produced by Crazy In Love and 1 Thing hitmaker Rich Harrison this dose of playboy repellent serves as a faint reminder of a music moment somewhat ahead of its time 9 Sposed To Be On Libra Take This Ring was the upbeat single deserving more Sposed To Be was the slow jam that could have been more A great candidate for quiet storm or lovemaking playlists this deep cut radiates an intergalactic tranquility and infectious bridge highlighting the finesse of Braxton s later discography 8 Hands Tied The second single of Pulse came as another one of Braxton s sultrier career moments With an urgent vocal performance the allure of Hands Tied exists in its zephyrous keyboard chords The song also provided a glimpse into the softer side of Warren Oak Felder who d go on to produce for Rihanna and Demi Lovato 7 Another Sad Love Song From its opening oh s and woah s over a slinky melody the first official single from Toni Braxton played on R B s knack for providing radio with sad tunes With an addictive hook racking brains like crazy the song reached No 7 on the Hot 100 and earned a Grammy for Best R B Vocal Performance Female 6 I Love Me Some Him If R B radio is unanimously consistent with playing one Toni Braxton single since its release I Love Me Some Him would hold that title for sure Regarded as one of her signatures the song was released as a double A side single to the R Kelly penned I Don t Want To The best part exists at the end of this cosmopolitan ode Braxton s vocal harmonizing with the instrumental stealing the show 5 Find Me A Man Today Secrets remains without a skippable track It also contains the singer s best deep cut In terms of essential Toni Braxton Find Me A Man shows the singer s ability to draw listeners into her raw emotion over a cerebral melody Here heartbreak reigns as the songstress finds herself tired of being alone dreaming up the irresistible qualities of her Prince Charming 4 Un Break My Heart Standing as one of the greatest power ballads to ever exist this Hot 100 chart topper is the central song of Braxton s career Vibrant in grandiose theatrics and a heart wrenching chorus in the midst of vocal acrobatics Un Break My Heart would sit at the summit for 11 weeks 3 Breathe Again As these Toni Braxton songs age this single from her debut still finds its way on R B rotation today Sparkling in Sade centric balladry and Diane Warren lyrics the breathy chorus and stagnant verses displayed by Braxton execute the song s intended moodiness Breathe Again would become a No 3 hit and earn the singer s second Grammy win for Best R B Vocal Performance Female 2 He Wasn t Man Enough For Me The new millennium might have seen a new look and sound from the diva but her anthemic spirit remained fervent In the league of No Scrubs and Independent Women Pt 1 this song holds its own rightful spot Produced by Rodney Darkchild Jerkins this signature dance bop was blocked from the Hot 100 s top spot by the stronghold of Carlos Santana and The Product G B s Maria Maria Today it s revisited by those realizing a past flame couldn t handle it all 1 Let It Flow Paired alongside You re Makin Me High this double A side single peaked at No 1 on the Hot 100 Unlike its partnered uptempo jaunt Let It Flow drifts like a slow running stream guided by the presence of a hypnotizing guitar Staying in line with the anthems Braxton has provided prior to and after Let It Flow the song became a mainstay on radio the Waiting To Exhale Soundtrack and most importantly Braxton s performance catalogue Simply put Let It Flow could have been done by none other than the superstar herself particularly the mesmerizing ending '
