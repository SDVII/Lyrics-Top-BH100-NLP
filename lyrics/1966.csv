10,Ballad of the Green Berets,SSgt. Barry Sadler,1966,"b'In the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s politics and music had a close relationship. Events like the Vietnam War and student protests coincided with a larger and more popular movement of political protest music. While it can be argued that protest music was caused by political events and ideas it is equally valid to argue that protest music was a significant part of the culture that led to many of the political events seen in the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s. For this reason it is impossible to conclude that one concretely caused the other. In addition all protest songs can be used to argue either theory of causality. Because protest music and politics were so deeply intertwined during this time period neither fully caused the other. However both helped to influence the society that in turn resulted in political events and protest music.\nFor protest music to cause political events or vice versa the two must first be related. In society politics and music have been related most fundamentally by songs that discuss politics or political ideals. While this has existed in society since long before the Vietnam War the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s was the first era when politically focused music expanded beyond a niche audience and had widespread popularity. In addition during the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s protest musicians had a close relationship with the protest movement as a whole which allowed them to reach a broader audience and have a greater effect.\nThe relationship between music and politics is most evidenced by the existence of songs dealing with political topics. Before the Vietnam War this was most common is songs discussing unions and the labor movement. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there aught we hold in common with the greedy parasite / who would lash us into serfdom and would crush us with his might? / Is there anything left to us but to organize and fight? / For the union makes us strong.\xe2\x80\x9d This example comes from the song \xe2\x80\x9cSolidarity Forever\xe2\x80\x9d written in 1919 and performed by Pete Seeger in 1949. The song gives a direct political commentary on employers and unions one that is not subtle or hidden. The song argues that unions must be formed to combat the greed of employers a belief in line with the labor movements of the time. This shows that there had been a tradition of protest songs before the Vietnam War. Another protest song from 1963 protests racism and societal injustice. \xe2\x80\x9c that even a noble is properly handled. / And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom / stared at the person who killed for no reason\xe2\x80\xa6 and handed out for penalty and repentance / William Zanzinger with a six month sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d This song protests racism within the justice system by telling the story of a black woman killed by a white man who later receives only a six-month sentence for the murder. This song was released in 1963 and provides an example of a song from the mid-sixties using a specific event to protest a social problem racism and argue for reform. Both examples show how political beliefs were incorporated into music. Despite the popularity they gained during the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s political and protest songs were not new occurrences.\nIn the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s protest songs were more popular than the protest songs of previous decades. While political music existed before the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s these protest songs often appealed to only small groups within society. For this reason much of this protest music especially that regarding the labor movement did not reach the widespread popularity that protest songs enjoyed during the sixties. The example by Pete Seeger  was indicative of most political songs from the labor movement in that it was designed to be a call to arms for union members to be used during strikes and rallies. As a result it had little appeal in other settings or for nonunion members. This had the effect of limiting the applicability of the song and decreasing its widespread popularity.\n\xc2\xa0The limited popularity of protest music was reversed during the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s. This reversal was a result both of political events such as the Vietnam War and the draft that were important to the entire nation  and of the modern system of music distribution. The Vietnam War gave protest music a greater importance to listeners even if the songs did not explicitly discuss the war. In addition music in the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s had a much more efficient distribution system than was previously available. Radio distributed songs throughout the entire country and cheap vinyl records allowed listeners access to a greater variety of music. In addition music charts like the Billboard Top 100 and later the American Top 40 consolidated the songs played across the country into a single mainstream music culture. This allowed songs to be easily distributed across the entire country giving them a huge audience and widespread radio play.\nThese factors let protest songs enter the primarily pop music charts and spread political commentaries and ideas. For example in 1965 Barry McGuire\xe2\x80\x99s song \xe2\x80\x9cEve of Destruction\xe2\x80\x9d reached number one in the US Hot 100 music chart. This song gave a description of war and chaos in the atomic age stating that modern society has not yet realized it is on the \xe2\x80\x9ceve of destruction.\xe2\x80\x9d Similarly SSgt Barry Sadler\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBallad of the Green Berets\xe2\x80\x9d reached number one on the same chart and remained there for six weeks. This song was a reaction to protest of the Vietnam War and patriotically described the Green Berets with the intention of raising patriotic sentiment to support the war. While this does not prove that political protest songs were listened to and appreciated for their political meanings this does show that songs with very political messages both for and against the Vietnam War had very wide radio play. This means that they would have been played across the country and liked at least musically by many. Ultimately this means that a very large number of people would have heard these songs and at least been exposed to their political messages.\nIn addition to its popularity protest music had a very close relationship to the overall protest movement especially those protesting the war and the draft furthering the ties between politics and music. Evidence of this was shown in the construction of large music festivals. Woodstock and music festivals like it featured artists like Country Joe and the Fish whose song \xe2\x80\x9cI-Feel-Like-I\xe2\x80\x99m-Fixin\xe2\x80\x99-To-Die Rag\xe2\x80\x9d directly protested the Vietnam War and the draft and Jefferson Airplane whose \xe2\x80\x9cVolunteers\xe2\x80\x9d advocated for a complete overthrow of the current social order. For a listener to pay to see a music festival they would most likely be familiar with the music of the bands playing would like the music and would most likely agree with the ideas expressed in the music. In addition many of the people attending these concerts were themselves student protesters. These music festivals were filled with the same young people who led student protests at universities and featured the same artists that led the creation of protest music.\nThis support sometimes went beyond just having the same political views. For example at the Monterey International Pop Festival a 1967 music festival in California \xe2\x80\x9cnearly all of the performers would play for free with the proceeds slated to go to youth-friendly causes.\xe2\x80\x9d In this case the artists\xe2\x80\x99 support for the political protest movements goes beyond ideological support for the protesters to monetarily supporting the same things. More broadly protest musicians also wrote songs about student protests in which they firmly sided with the protesters supporting their actions and condemning those trying to stop the protests. For example Buffalo Springfield describes protests in their song \xe2\x80\x9cFor What It\xe2\x80\x99s Worth\xe2\x80\x9d saying \xe2\x80\x9cYoung people speakin\xe2\x80\x99 their minds\xe2\x80\xa8/ and gettin\xe2\x80\x99 so much resistance from behind\xe2\x80\xa6 Step out of line the man come and take you away.\xe2\x80\x9d This gives an example of a protest song that describes student protests siding with the protesters that made up much of their musical audience.\nProtest music is defined as music that discusses or protests the current social and political state. During the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s protest music and political music reached a wider popularity than if had enjoyed before that time. In addition radio and vinyl allowed protest music to be distributed more widely than before. This emphasized its political effect. However was the protest music caused by the politics of the time or did protest music have its own effect in influencing and creating political events? This issue can be argued both ways although the dominant theory is that the politics caused protest music while the secondary theory argues that protest music caused political events. However the relationship between music and politics in the Vietnam War era was so deeply intertwined that neither can be proven to have caused the other. The dominant view of the causality between protest music and politics is that protest music was caused by political events. At the base of this argument is the fact that a protest is by definition a reaction to an event. Protest music was caused by the politics because political events had to exist to be protested.\nFor protest music to be caused by politics protest songs must protest against specific events and beliefs which occurred previous to the music. This is evidenced by songs that provided commentary on specific events. For example Bob Dylan reacted to the killing of Hattie Carroll with his song \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\xe2\x80\x9d . In this case the song was a direct reaction to the killing of Hattie Carroll and her killer who received only a six-month sentence. \xe2\x80\x9cThe story came from a newspaper clipping Gordon Friesen gave Dylan\xe2\x80\xa6 It was a report of the sentencing that sparked Dylan\xe2\x80\x99s song.\xe2\x80\x9d Dylan wrote this song to protest not only the event but also the larger problems of racism and corruption in the justice system. In this case an event is used as an example of larger societal problems but all of the things protested happened previous to the composition of the song and were the direct causes of Dylan\xe2\x80\x99s writing the song. Another example of a song reacting to a specific event is The Byrd\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHe Was a Friend of Mine.\xe2\x80\x9d It commented on President Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s assassination saying \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a friend of mine / his killing had no purpose nor reason nor rhyme\xe2\x80\xa6 he was in Dallas town\xe2\x80\xa6 a gunner shot him down.\xe2\x80\x9d This song was a reaction to the death of JFK and the slow solemn tone of the song and its portrayal of the president as a friend make a sympathetic and mournful depiction of the president which was in itself a political stance. In this case the song is a direct reaction to an event the assassination of president Kennedy and would not have been written had the assassination not taken place.\nFor politics to have caused protest music the protest music must not only protest a specific previous event but must also have been dependent on the existence of the political event. If the political event had not happened then the protest song could not have been written. For example after the Kent State Shootings Crosby Stills Nash and Young wrote the song \xe2\x80\x9cOhio.\xe2\x80\x9d It discussed the shootings in which four students were killed by state troops in the culmination of nationwide student protests by describing the fallout of the event from the protesters\xe2\x80\x99 point of view. \xe2\x80\x9cTin soldiers and Nixon coming \xe2\x80\xa8/ We\xe2\x80\x99re finally on our own.\xe2\x80\xa8/ This summer I hear the drumming\xe2\x80\xa8/ Four dead in Ohio. /\xe2\x80\xa8Gotta get down to it\xe2\x80\xa8/ Soldiers are cutting us down."" The fact that state troopers had fired on protesters was profoundly shocking both to political protesters and to the creators of protest music. To them this showed that the government was so firmly supportive of the things students were protesting that they were willing to kill to maintain the social order. This is reflected by the song which declares that they are now \xe2\x80\x9con their own\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9csoldiers are cutting  down.\xe2\x80\x9d Ultimately the Kent State Shootings combined with the reelection of Richard Nixon to begin the decline of the protest movement. These events made clear that their protests would be met with armed resistance that could end in their own death. In addition Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s reelection made it unlikely that the protesters would make much if any progress politically. This shows how individual political events inspired protest songs that reacted to those specific events and showed changes in belief that would not have occurred had the political events not happened.\nThe challenging view of the causality of politics and protest music is that protest music caused political events. This argues that protest music caused a shift in the political beliefs of its audience. This change in beliefs made the musical audience more opposed to later political events like the Vietnam War and the draft which in turn led to political events like student protests and tensions over the war. This argument relies on three main points. First that protest music voiced and argued for a change in political beliefs different from the beliefs held by the majority of society. Second that protest music succeeded in persuading its audience of these beliefs. Third that this change in belief led to disagreement with the political events that followed and that these tensions led to the political climate of the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s and political events like student protests.\nProtest music was unique among the forms of popular music of the time because its purpose was to voice political beliefs. More importantly the political beliefs voiced by these songs were different from and in opposition to the primary political beliefs of the time. The political beliefs these songs protested were generally classified as those held by the older generation most especially those of the people running the government or other societal institutions. Bob Dylan exemplifies this generational split in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Times They Are A-Changin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d saying \xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t criticize\xe2\x80\xa8/ what you can\xe2\x80\x99t understand\xe2\x80\xa8/ your sons and your daughters\xe2\x80\xa8/ Are beyond your command\xe2\x80\xa6 For the times they are a-changin.\xe2\x80\x9d This song embodies the change in political beliefs by speaking directly to the older generation warning that the changing times will affect everyone from those in power to society as a whole. It also deepens the perceived difference in belief by going so far as to say that the older generation is not even capable of understanding the views of the younger generation. This song also uses an assumption that is used in most protest music- that the older generation is synonymous with those in power and with those who oppose the protests of the younger generation. This generational split was also shown by Jefferson Airplane in their \xe2\x80\x9cVolunteers.\xe2\x80\x9d This song is one of the most radical of those that advocate for social change arguing for a violent overthrow of the older generation and those in power. \xe2\x80\x9cOne generation got old / One generation got soul\xe2\x80\xa6 Come on now we\xe2\x80\x99re marching to the sea / got a revolution got to revolution / who will take it from you? / We will and who are we? / We are volunteers of America.\xe2\x80\x9d This shows a split in political belief that is so broad as to require an overthrow of the current social order in order to promote their beliefs. This song also advocates for social change because its of connection with the beliefs set forth in Jefferson Airplane\xe2\x80\x99s other songs like \xe2\x80\x9cWhite Rabbit\xe2\x80\x9d which discussed drug use and \xe2\x80\x9cPlastic Fantastic Lover\xe2\x80\x9d which criticized the fake and plastic nature of society. Both of these songs exemplify the split in beliefs between those in power and those writing protest music by arguing for a change in or even overthrow of those in power. This shows how protest music would have delivered a message advocating a change in political beliefs. However this music would only have an effect on political events if the message they put forth affected the beliefs of listeners in some way.\nProtest music put forth views on politics and society that not only opposed the beliefs generally accepted by society but also succeeded in persuading its audience of these beliefs. This is shown less by the songs themselves but instead by their reception. For example Barry McGuire\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cEve of Destruction\xe2\x80\x9d  protested against nuclear proliferation and the Vietnam War. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re old enough to kill but not for votin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa8/ you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in war but what\xe2\x80\x99s that gun you\xe2\x80\x99re totin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa6 you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\xe2\x80\xa8/ we\xe2\x80\x99re on the eve of destruction\xe2\x80\xa6 If the button is pushed there\xe2\x80\x99s no runnin\xe2\x80\x99 away\xe2\x80\xa8/ There\xe2\x80\x99ll be no one to save with the world in a grave.\xe2\x80\x9d This song clearly and rather pessimistically declares that humanity is on the \xe2\x80\x9ceve of destruction\xe2\x80\x9d because of the threat of nuclear war. The song voices basic pacifist complaints regarding the post-atomic world beliefs that were also shared by most members of political protest groups. This meant that the political message of the song would have been viewed favorably by its audience. In addition in 1965 this song reached number one in the US meaning that it would have had a very wide distribution and a large amount of radio play so its message would have been widely known. More importantly the song presents the political message in a very obvious and clear way meaning that it would have been harder to miss the meaning of the song when listening to it. This means that the song\xe2\x80\x99s message would have to have been favorable to many to reach that degree of popularity.\nAnother factor determining the effect of a protest song\xe2\x80\x99s political message would have been the degree to which the politics it discussed would have affected the lives of its audience members. This gave many songs discussing the war and pacifism a greater importance to their audience. As the Vietnam War progressed more of the young people who made up the musical audience were drafted and sent to go fight. The majority of protest music argued that the war was unnecessary and the draft unfair a view that would have been sympathetic to most of the people being drafted. For example Bob Dylan discusses war and those who control it in his \xe2\x80\x9cMasters of War\xe2\x80\x9d saying \xe2\x80\x9cYou fasten the triggers\xe2\x80\xa8/ for the others to fire\xe2\x80\xa6 You hide in your mansion / as young people\xe2\x80\x99s blood\xe2\x80\xa8/ Flows out of their bodies /\xe2\x80\xa8And is buried in the mud.\xe2\x80\x9d Dylan protests the \xe2\x80\x9cmasters of war\xe2\x80\x9d who engineer war for their own profit disregarding the violence and death they cause. Although it protests more generally against the nature of war its message would have become more important as the Vietnam War progressed. Because the song was released before the draft was widely instituted this sentiment would become more important as the Vietnam War led to greater numbers of young people being drafted to fight in Vietnam. In this case these ideas were put forth in songs released before the political event- the Vietnam War and the use of the draft- and sparked the political sentiments that fueled the protests against the war and the draft. This shows how protest songs helped to influence the political beliefs of their audience and affected the way in which they reacted to subsequent political events.\nAs protest music succeeded in changing the political beliefs of its audience listeners now had a greater disagreement with the political events that followed. This disagreement characterized the political climate as a whole and led to events like the reaction to the draft and student protests. The tension between protest music and its audience was exemplified by songs like Jefferson Airplane\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cVolunteers\xe2\x80\x9d  or Tom Paxton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Blue\xe2\x80\x9d a sinister song which gives a dystopic portrayal of those controlling society painting a picture of a society that expects specific beliefs and actions and is willing to resort to violent means to maintain those expectations. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a slot to fill and fill that slot you will\xe2\x80\xa8/ You\xe2\x80\x99ll learn to love it or we\xe2\x80\x99ll break you.\xe2\x80\xa8/ Oh what will it take to whip you into line?\xe2\x80\xa8/ A broken heart? A broken head?\xe2\x80\xa8/ It can be arranged. It can be arranged.\xe2\x80\x9d This shows how the artists making protest music viewed society and government as coercive and despotic. These beliefs would have put them in direct opposition to everything that the government and society did as well as the very existence of the current government. This view of society and government fueled much of the reactions on the part of protesters especially the students protests seen at most universities during this time period. The views of the protesters were shown by many songs about the Vietnam War and the draft especially Country Joe and the Fish\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI-Feel-Like-I\xe2\x80\x99m-Fixin\xe2\x80\x99-To-Die Rag\xe2\x80\x9d . \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we fighting for? / Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me I don\xe2\x80\x99t give a damn / next stop it\xe2\x80\x99s Vietnam.\xe2\x80\x9d This voices the protesters\xe2\x80\x99 belief that the war was meaningless and unnecessary and opposes those in the government and in society who wanted them to go and fight in Vietnam. However this song had a more nihilistic quality. \xe2\x80\x9cCountry Joe also brought a spirit of protest to Woodstock\xe2\x80\xa6 his \xe2\x80\x98I-Feel-Like-I\xe2\x80\x99m-Fixin\xe2\x80\x99-To-Die Rag\xe2\x80\x99 more grimly pertinent than when it had been released two years ago\xe2\x80\xa6 said a great deal about how the mood had changed from earlier periods: the hopefulness and sobriety of both Newport and the March on Washington had been replaced by bitter despair and ebullient self-indulgence."" It protested the war but still was not convinced that anything the protesters did would have an effect. Protest music succeeded in producing music that changed the political beliefs of its audience. This ideological change led to greater tensions between this audience and the actions of the government. This resulted in tensions which were expressed in the widespread student protests. Protest music written about topics like war and pacifism successfully caused political events like the reaction to the draft showing how protest music brought about the political climate of the time.\nDuring the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s political events like the Vietnam War coincided with a large movement of protest music. Artists writing protest songs wrote music that was more popular than previous protest artists and had a larger impact. Because political events like the Vietnam War and the draft and protest music were so closely related each must have had some role in causing or propagating the other. The two main arguments regarding this are either that political events caused protest music by giving musicians something to protest or that protest music caused political events like student protests by influencing the political climate so that events like student protests happened. However in this case the lines of causality are so blurred that it cannot be argued that music caused politics any more than political events caused protest music. For example a song like Barry McGuire\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cEve of Destruction\xe2\x80\x9d can be used to argue both theories. The song protests the threat of nuclear war and its mention of how \xe2\x80\x9cif the button is pushed there\xe2\x80\x99s no runnin\xe2\x80\x99 away\xe2\x80\x9d shows a direct protest to the existence of the nuclear bomb and the threat of nuclear warfare. This supports the first theory that political events in this case the invention of the nuclear bomb caused protest songs. However the song was very successful and its long stint in the Top 100 charts shows that the song would have been heard by many people. This song and other like it would have shifted public opinion toward pacifism and would have heightened public awareness of the possibility of nuclear warfare. This had the effect of shifting public opinion against military ventures like the Vietnam War and would have led to political events like student protests. In this way nearly every protest song can be used to argue both theories. In this case protest music and political events were so closely tied that one cannot be determined to have solely caused the other. As a result neither theory is applicable so the exact causality cannot be determined.\nBibliography.'"
